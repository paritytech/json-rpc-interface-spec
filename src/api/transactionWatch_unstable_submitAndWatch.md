# transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch

**Parameters**:

- `transaction`: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded transaction to try to include in a block.

**Return value**: String representing the subscription.

The string returned by this function is opaque and its meaning can't be interpreted by the JSON-RPC client. It is only meant to be matched with the `subscription` field of events and potentially passed to `transactionWatch_unstable_unwatch`.

Once this function has been called, the server will try to propagate this transaction over the peer-to-peer network and/or include it onto the chain even if `transactionWatch_unstable_unwatch` is called or that the JSON-RPC client disconnects. In other words, it is not possible to cancel submitting a transaction.

The JSON-RPC server must accept at least 4 `transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch` subscriptions per JSON-RPC client.
Trying to open more might lead to a JSON-RPC error when calling `transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch`.

## Notifications format

This function will later generate one or more notifications in the following format:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "transactionWatch_unstable_watchEvent",
    "params": {
        "subscription": "...",
        "result": ...
    }
}
```

Where `subscription` is the value returned by this function, and `result` can be one of:

### validated

```json
{
    "event": "validated"
}
```

The `validated` event indicates that this transaction has been checked and is considered as valid by the runtime.

This transaction might still become invalid in the future, for example because a conflicting transaction is included in the chain in-between.

Multiple `validated` events can be generated during the lifetime of a transaction. If multiple `validated` events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last one.

**Note**: In theory, this event could include a field indicating the block against which this transaction was validated. It has been decided to not include this field for pragmatic reasons: implementing it might be complicated, and it is not very useful for a JSON-RPC client to know this information.

### bestChainBlockIncluded

```json
{
    "event": "bestChainBlockIncluded",
    "block": {
        "hash": "...",
        "index": ...
    }
}
```

Or

```json
{
    "event": "bestChainBlockIncluded",
    "block": null
}
```

The `bestChainBlockIncluded` event indicates which block of the best chain the transaction is included in.

`null` can be sent back in case the block is no longer in any block of the best chain. This is the state a transaction starts in.

`hash` is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block. `index` is an integer indicating the 0-based index of this transaction within the body of this block.

If multiple `bestChainBlockIncluded` events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last.

**Note**: Please note that these is no guarantee that the mentioned block matches any of the blocks returned by `chainHead_unstable_follow`.

### finalized

```json
{
    "event": "finalized",
    "block": {
        "hash": "...",
        "index": ...
    }
}
```

The `finalized` event indicates that this transaction is present in a block of the chain that is finalized.

`hash` is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block. `index` is an integer indicating the 0-based index of this transaction within the body of this block.

No more event will be generated about this transaction.

### error

```json
{
    "event": "error",
    "error": "..."
}
```

The `error` event indicates that an internal error within the client has happened.

Examples include: the runtime crashes, the runtime is missing the function to validate a transaction, the format of the value returned by the runtime is invalid, etc.

This typically indicates a bug in the runtime of the chain or an incompatibility between the client and the runtime of the chain, and there is nothing the end user can do to fix the problem.

The transaction that has been submitted will not be included in the chain by the local node, but it could be included by sending it via a different client implementation.

`error` is a human-readable error message indicating what happened. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

No more event will be generated about this transaction.

### invalid

```json
{
    "event": "invalid",
    "error": "..."
}
```

The `invalid` event indicates that the runtime has marked the transaction as invalid.

This can happen for a variety of reasons specific to the chain, such as a bad signature, bad nonce, not enough balance for fees, etc.

`error` is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction is invalid. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

No more event will be generated about this transaction.

### dropped

```json
{
    "event": "dropped",
    "error": "..."
}
```

The `dropped` event indicates that the client wasn't capable of keeping track of this transaction.

This can happen for example if the JSON-RPC server's transactions pool is full, if the JSON-RPC server's resources have reached their limit, if the block the transaction is included in takes too long to be finalized, or the syncing requires a gap in the chain that prevents the JSON-RPC server from knowing whether the transaction has been included and/or finalized.

`error` is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction has been dropped. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

No more event will be generated about this transaction.

## Transaction state

One can build a mental model in order to understand which events can be generated. While a transaction is being watched, it has the following properties:

- `isValidated`: `yes` or `not-yet`. A transaction is initially `not-yet` validated. A `validated` event indicates that the transaction has now been validated. After a certain number of blocks or in case of retractation, a transaction automatically becomes `not-yet` validated and needs to be validated again. No event is generated to indicate that a transaction is no longer validated, however a `validated` event will be generated again when a transaction is validated again.

- `bestChainBlockIncluded`: an optional block hash and index. A transaction is initially included in no block. It can automatically become included in a block of the best chain. A `bestChainBlockIncluded` event reports updates to this property.

Note that these two properties are orthogonal. In particular, a transaction can be included in a block before being validated.

The `finalized`, `error`, `invalid`, and `dropped` event indicate that the transaction is no longer being watched. The state of the transaction is entirely discarded.

JSON-RPC servers are allowed to skip sending events as long as it properly keeps the JSON-RPC client up to date with the state of the transaction. In other words, multiple `validated` or `bestChainBlockIncluded` events in a row might be merged into one.

**Note**: In order to implement this properly, JSON-RPC servers should maintain a buffer of three notifications (one for each property), and overwrite any unsent notification with a more recent status update.

## Possible errors

- A JSON-RPC error with error code `-32800` can be generated if the JSON-RPC client has already opened 4 or more `transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch` subscriptions.
- A JSON-RPC error with error code `-32602` is generated if the `transaction` parameter has an invalid format, but no error is produced if the bytes of the `transaction`, once decoded, are invalid. Instead, an `invalid` notification will be generated.
