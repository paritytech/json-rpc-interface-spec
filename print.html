<p>This document contains the specification of the JSON-RPC interface exposed by blockchain nodes in the Substrate ecosystem.</p>
<p>This specification aims at establishing a <em>lingua franca</em> between UIs, tools, etc. that would like to access a Substrate-based blockchain, and node client implementations that actually connect to the blockchain. Please note that it is, however, in no way mandatory for nodes to implement this specification in order to access a Substrate-based blockchain. As such, this specification is out of scope of, say, the Polkadot host specification.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h1>
<p>The objective of this JSON-RPC interface is to accomodate multiple kinds of audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-user-facing applications that want to read and interact with the blockchain.</li>
<li>Node operators to want to make sure that their node is operating correctly, and perform some administrative operations such as rotating keys.</li>
<li>Core/parachain developers that want to manually look at the storage and figure out what is happening on the blockchain.</li>
<li>Oracles or bridges need to be able to read and interface with the blockchain.</li>
<li>Archivers want to look at past data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-user-facing-applications"><a class="header" href="#end-user-facing-applications">End-user-facing applications</a></h2>
<p>End-user-facing applications, such as a wallet or an unstoppable application, need to be able to read the storage of the blockchain and submit transactions.</p>
<p>These applications perform JSON-RPC function calls either against a node run locally by the end-user, or against a trusted JSON-RPC server. The locally-run node solution is strictly better for security and decentralization reasons, and we would like to encourage this. The trusted JSON-RPC server should be used as a back-up solution only in case it is not possible to run a node locally.</p>
<p>In order to be more user-friendly, a node run locally is very often a <em>light client</em> that doesn't hold the storage of the blockchain in its memory. The JSON-RPC functions are designed having in mind the fact that the target of the function calls might be a light client that doesn't have all the needed information immediately available.</p>
<p>End-user-facing applications generally rarely need to access older blocks. They usually care only about the storage of the finalized block and of the best block.</p>
<p>End-user-facing applications would normally not directly use the JSON-RPC interface, but an intermediary layer library built on top of the JSON-RPC interface. The JSON-RPC interface is a bit complicated to use, in a exchange for making functions more explicit and predictable.</p>
<p>An end-user-facing application is typically a website that the end-user visits. Both in the case of a locally-run node and in the case of a remote node, the JSON-RPC server is subject to attacks by malicious applications as an application can ask the end-user's browser to send millions of requests to the server. For this reason, it is important for the JSON-RPC server to resist to some degree to attacks (both DoS attacks and vulnerabilities), and thus for the JSON-RPC interface to not require behaviors that contradict DoS resilience.</p>
<p>When calls are made against a node run locally, the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important. However, the JSON-RPC functions have a very precise behavior, in order to avoid situations where an ambiguity in what the JSON-RPC client desires leads the JSON-RPC server to use more bandwidth than is strictly required.</p>
<p>When calls are made against a trusted JSON-RPC server, the bandwidth consumption and latency are more important. However, one should keep in mind that we would like to discourage trusted JSON-RPC servers.</p>
<h2 id="node-operators"><a class="header" href="#node-operators">Node operators</a></h2>
<p>DevOps that are administering a node (be it a full node, a validator, or an archive node) want to be able to know whether their node is operating properly, and might want to change some configuration options while the node is running.</p>
<p>DevOps are usually familiar with bash scripts. In order to make their life easier, the functions in the JSON-RPC interface that are relevant to them are usable with just a few CLI tools. The <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat">websocat</a> CLI tool is probably the easiest way to communicate over a WebSocket connection at the time of writing of this document.</p>
<p>DevOps shouldn't have to use unstable functions when writing bash scripts. They want to be able to run scripts automatically in the background without them breaking. As such, the functions that they need are stable.</p>
<p>Since scripts usually run on the same machine or a machine in the same data center as the target of the JSON-RPC function calls, the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important for this usage.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-developers"><a class="header" href="#debugging-developers">Debugging developers</a></h2>
<p>Core/parachain developers want to be able to look at the on-chain storage or the internal state of a node, for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>When debugging the chain or the node implementation, developers rarely care about the stability of the function they use. They perform manual function calls using some tools (either a UI or a CLI tool) and throw away the function call once they're finished debugging.</p>
<p>In order to accomodate this audience, it should be relatively easy to perform a JSON-RPC function call manually, and developers should be able to easily add to the interface new semi-temporary JSON-RPC functions specific to their debugging needs.</p>
<p>The target of the JSON-RPC function calls is either their own node, or a specific node that has encountered an issue, and the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important for this usage.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-and-bridges"><a class="header" href="#oracles-and-bridges">Oracles and bridges</a></h2>
<p>Oracles and bridges consist for example in cryptocurencies exchanges or any software that programmatically interacts with a chain.</p>
<p>Contrary to end-user-facing applications, no human is interfacing directly or indirectly with the JSON-RPC client. Everything is automatic.
However, everything said in the section about end-user-facing applications also applies here.</p>
<h2 id="archivers"><a class="header" href="#archivers">Archivers</a></h2>
<p>Archivers are websites or applications that want to look at the past state of the chain.</p>
<p>In order to accomodate this audience, the JSON-RPC interface should provide functions that lets you access any block of the chain, and the storage of the chain at any block.
Note that pruned blocks, in other words blocks that aren't descendants of the latest finalized blocks, are out of scope of this use case as inspecting them isn't considered useful for archiving purposes.</p>
<p>Apart from this difference, this category is a mix between &quot;end-user-facing applications&quot; and &quot;node operators&quot;.</p>
<p>Archivers expect the JSON-RPC function calls to be stable and easy to use. They normally don't pay too much attention to performances and don't optimize their code, as long as everything is relatively fast.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-json-rpc"><a class="header" href="#why-json-rpc">Why JSON-RPC?</a></h1>
<p>The JSON-RPC protocol has been chosen over other protocols such as gRPC due to its simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Protocol specification formats such as https://open-rpc.org/ have been considered, but are unfortunately lacking the capabilities to describe subscriptions, and their interest is therefore limited.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grouping-functions-and-node-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#grouping-functions-and-node-capabilities">Grouping functions and node capabilities</a></h1>
<p>All JSON-RPC functions in this interface are distributed between so-called groups.</p>
<p>The group a JSON-RPC function belongs to is indicated by the <code>prefix_</code> in its name. This prefix includes a version number. For example, in <code>foo_v1_bar</code> the prefix is <code>foo_v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="node-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#node-capabilities">Node capabilities</a></h2>
<p>This JSON-RPC interface is intended to be implemented on various types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full nodes, which hold in their database all block headers and bodies, plus the storage of recent blocks.</li>
<li>Light clients, which only know the headers of recent blocks.</li>
<li>Archive nodes, which hold.</li>
<li>Plain databases that aren't actually connected to the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>These various node implementations have different capabilities, and it is normal for some implementations to only support some functions and not others. It doesn't make sense for example for a light client to support a function that rotates keys.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC server must always support the <code>rpc_methods</code> function, and clients should use this function to determine which other functions are supported.</p>
<p>In order to not introducing too much confusion and complexity, supporting a group of functions is all or nothing. Either all functions in a group are supported, or none of them. This rule reduces the complexity that a JSON-RPC client has to face to determine what a JSON-RPC server is capable of.</p>
<h2 id="upgradability"><a class="header" href="#upgradability">Upgradability</a></h2>
<p>A group name must always include a version number. This version number is part of the group name it self, and consequently <code>foo_v1</code> and <code>foo_v2</code> should be considered as two completely separate, unrelated, groups.</p>
<p>As explained in the previous section, some nodes might support some groups and not others. For example, some nodes might support only <code>foo_v1</code>, some others only <code>foo_v2</code>, some others both, and some others neither.</p>
<p>Each group must be self-contained, and not build on top of functions of a different group. For example, <code>foo_v1_start</code> can only be stopped with <code>foo_v1_stop</code> and <code>foo_v2_start</code> can only be stopped with <code>foo_v2_stop</code>. <code>foo_v1_stop</code> must not be able to stop <code>foo_v2_start</code> and vice versa. For this reason, if the version number of a group is increased, all functions that are still relevant should be duplicated in the new group.</p>
<p>Having a clear version number makes it clear for developers that some functions (with a higher version number) are preferred over some others. For example, when <code>foo_v2</code> is introduced, developers automatically understand that <code>foo_v1</code> is soft-deprecated.</p>
<h2 id="unstable-functions"><a class="header" href="#unstable-functions">Unstable functions</a></h2>
<p>No guarantee is offered as to the stability of functions with <code>unstable</code> as their version number. They can disappear, get renamed, change parameters, or change return value without any warning.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, higher-level applications should not rely on unstable functions. Please open an issue in this repository if some critical feature is missing or is only covered by an unstable function.</p>
<p>The presence of unstable functions in the interface exposed by a JSON-RPC server is not a problem by itself. Not all functions are destined to be stabilized, and it is normal for some functions to remain unstable forever.</p>
<p>Unstable functions are especially useful for core/parachain developers to add debugging utilities to their client implementation. For example, if a developer wants to investigate the list of Grandpa votes, they could introduce a function named <code>grandpa_unstable_votes</code>.</p>
<p>It is expected that all new functions added to this interface go through a testing phase during which they're unstable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dos-attacks-resilience"><a class="header" href="#dos-attacks-resilience">DoS attacks resilience</a></h1>
<p><em>This page is at the same time a small guide explaining how to handle DoS attacks, and explains the motivation behind some design decisions.</em></p>
<p>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack consists in consuming all the resources (bandwidth, CPU, or memory) of the target in order to prevent the target from properly serving legitimate users. It is possible to mitigate a DoS attack by identifying the attackers and filtering them out, but this is never done by the final JSON-RPC server that actually processes requests. From the point of view of the final JSON-RPC server, a DoS attack is the same thing as being under very heavy load.</p>
<p>Because the resources available to the target are bounded, it is fundamentally impossible to claim to be able to resist to all DoS attacks. It is, however, possible to optimize and properly distribute resources consumption in order to increase the load that the target is capable of handling.</p>
<p>Additionally, and maybe more importantly, it is important to guarantee a good quality of service even when under heavy load.</p>
<h2 id="bounded-queues"><a class="header" href="#bounded-queues">Bounded queues</a></h2>
<p>In order to provide a good quality of service, the time between the moment a request is received by the server and the moment the response is sent back must be short. In order to achieve this, the CPU operations and I/O operations needed to handle the request must not take too much time. The only way to guarantee this is by limiting the number of CPU or I/O operations that can be performed concurrently. As an example, if you try to read 5000 files at once, some of these file reads will take a long time, and the only way to guarantee that a file read will be short is to not start too many at the same time.</p>
<p>This is generally achieved by creating a certain number of threads (lightweight or not) dedicated to handling a specific CPU or I/O operations. By doing so, you are guaranteed that the number of these CPU or I/O operations that are being executed simultaneously will never exceed the number of threads. In turn, this means that when an operation needs to be performed, it is put in a FIFO queue in order to be picked up by these threads. It is important for the sizes of all queues to be bounded, in order for memory usage to be bounded as well, and as otherwise operations could take a long time being stuck in a queue.</p>
<p>When a queue of operations is full, the dispatcher should simply wait for some space to be available. This is called <em>back-pressure</em>, as the dispatcher is intentionally slowed down as well. If the dispatcher is itself responsible for processing some operations in a queue, this processing is paused, and that queue is slowed down as well, which might cause more back-pressure to be propagated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Queues should be bounded such that, even when they are full, the time between the moment when an operation enters the queue and the moment when it is processed is reasonable. A bound that is too low can potentially lead to a decrease in performance due to an excess of context switches, but this is in practice rarely a problem.</p>
<p>This back-pressure must be propagated all the way to the TCP socket. When the code receiving requests from the TCP socket is unable to move forward because a queue is full, it should in turn stop receiving data from the TCP socket. This will in turn cause the Linux kernel to not increase the TCP window size, which propagates the back-pressure to the JSON-RPC client, slowing down this JSON-RPC client.</p>
<p>In multiplexing situations, where multiple threads (lightweight or not) all try to insert elements in a single bounded queue, it is important for the distribution of items to have an acceptable distribution. It must not happen that some threads are able to insert elements very quickly while some others need to sleep for a long time before their element is inserted.</p>
<p>Thanks to all these mechanisms, the amount of CPU and I/O consumed by all JSON-RPC clients combined is bounded and uniformly distributed between each JSON-RPC client, guaranteeing that they are equally slowed down. In order to guarantee a good quality of service to these clients, the final step is simply to limit the number of JSON-RPC clients that are allowed to connect. The precise limit depends on the capabilities of the machine running the JSON-RPC server.</p>
<h2 id="dispatching-a-notification-shouldnt-wait"><a class="header" href="#dispatching-a-notification-shouldnt-wait">Dispatching a notification shouldn't wait</a></h2>
<p>Some JSON-RPC functions in the API let clients subscribe to some events, such as a new block, meaning that the server must send a notification to the client when that specific event happens.</p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that these events, generated by the blockchain node, shouldn't be back-pressured. We do not want to slow down for example the reception of blocks by the node because the JSON-RPC server isn't capable of following the rhythm.</p>
<p>The events coming from the blockchain node can be seen as a stream. This stream can briefly be back-pressured, but ideally as little as possible. Whatever threads are on the receiving side of this stream of events should therefore consist only of CPU-only non-blocking operations.</p>
<p>However, sending a message to a JSON-RPC client might take a long time, in case the client has (intentionally or not) little bandwidth. The threads that are receiving the stream of events should never wait for a client to be ready to accept more data before sending a notification to it. If the client isn't ready, then the notification must either be added to a send queue or simply discarded. Because queues must be bounded, it is unavoidable to sometimes have to discard some notifications.</p>
<p>Consequently, all functions that consist in sending notifications must be designed having in mind that the queue of notifications to send out must be bounded to a certain value. For example, the queue of notifications for <code>transaction_unstable_submitAndWatch</code> must have a size of 3. When the queue is full, new notifications must overwrite the notifications already in the queue. The design of all JSON-RPC functions should take into account the fact that this shouldn't result in a loss of important information for the JSON-RPC client.</p>
<h2 id="distinguishing-between-light-and-heavy-calls"><a class="header" href="#distinguishing-between-light-and-heavy-calls">Distinguishing between light and heavy calls</a></h2>
<p>When implementing bounded queues, one should avoid a situation where some elements in the queue are very quick to be processed while some others very slow.</p>
<p>During normal operations one will decide on the size of the queue and number of processing threads based on the time it takes to process an average queue element, but during a DoS attack the attacker can deliberately push a larger number of elements that are heavy to process. For example, with a single queue of incoming JSON-RPC requests, an attacker can intentionally submit requests that take a long time to process, in order to fill the queue more quickly.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to sometimes split some queues, where light operations go on one queue and heavy operations on a different one.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why JSON-RPC functions are split by groups. In particular, the <code>archive</code>-prefixed JSON-RPC functions are, due to their disk access, considered as heavy and should be processed on a different queue than the other JSON-RPC functions. Under heavy load, it is likely that the processing of <code>archive</code>-prefixed JSON-RPC functions will be slowed down a lot, while the processing of other functions will be less impacted.</p>
<h2 id="enforced-limits"><a class="header" href="#enforced-limits">Enforced limits</a></h2>
<p>In order to limit the memory consumption and the latency of processing requests, it is important that requests that involve storing some state on the JSON-RPC server in the long term are subject to limits.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of JSON-RPC clients simultaneously connected must be bounded.</li>
<li>The number of active subscriptions (i.e. where the server sends a notification to the client when something happens) must be bounded.</li>
<li>The number of pinned blocks (in the context of <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>) must be bounded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The limits on the number of active subscriptions and pinned block should be enforced per client, as it would be undesirable to limit the number of subscriptions/pinned blocks available to some clients just because other clients are using a lot of them. Since the number of clients is bounded, enforcing these limits per client also automatically enforces these limits globally.</p>
<p>Note that the limit on the number of JSON-RPC clients simultaneously connected should be enforced by rejecting new clients with a 503 status code, rather than for example closing the TCP socket altogether. This makes it possible for other software in front of the JSON-RPC server, such as a load balancer, to understand what the problem is.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="load-balancers"><a class="header" href="#load-balancers">Load balancers</a></h1>
<p>In case of a publicly-accessible JSON-RPC server, it is unlikely for a single server to be able to handle the load of all the end users running JSON-RPC clients.</p>
<p>For this reason, the JSON-RPC interface is suitable for load balancer. A single load balancer can serve all the requests and dispatch them to multiple nodes.</p>
<p>With the exception of the JSON-RPC functions prefixed with ̀<code>sudo</code>, none of the JSON-RPC functions require stick sessions. In other words, if a JSON-RPC client disconnects from the load balancer, then reconnects, the load balancer can wire the connection to a different underlying server than the one it previously used. However, as long as a JSON-RPC client is connected, all its messages must be redirected to the same underlying JSON-RPC server. The underlying server can change only after a disconnect/reconnect.</p>
<h2 id="unsafe-json-rpc-functions"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-json-rpc-functions">Unsafe JSON-RPC functions</a></h2>
<p>In the legacy JSON-RPC interface, a flag on the server renders some JSON-RPC functions inaccessible. This is important in order to prevent the general public from accessing the node's configuration and sensitive data. In this new JSON-RPC interface, all the functions that shouldn't be publicly-accessible are prefixed with <code>sudo</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to insert proxies that filter incoming requests. All such proxy has to do is parse JSON-RPC requests and detect whether the function name starts with <code>sudo_</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, however, such proxy doesn't seem to exist, and JSON-RPC server implementations should continue to provide a configuration option (such as a CLI flag) to disable <code>sudo</code>-prefixed functions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="api-specification"><a class="header" href="#api-specification">API specification</a></h1>
<p>Note that all parameters are mandatory unless specified otherwise. All functions support two ways of calling them: either by passing an array with an ordered list of parameters, or by passing an object where parameters are named.</p>
<p>Any missing parameter, or parameter with an invalid format, should result in a JSON-RPC error being returned, as described in the JSON-RPC specification.</p>
<h2 id="glossary"><a class="header" href="#glossary">Glossary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;hexadecimal-encoded&quot; designates a binary value encoded as hexadecimal. The value must either be empty, or start with <code>&quot;0x&quot;</code> and contain an even number of characters.</li>
<li>&quot;SCALE-encoded&quot; designates a value encoded using <a href="https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/scale-codec/">the SCALE codec</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-networkconfig-parameter"><a class="header" href="#the-networkconfig-parameter">The <code>networkConfig</code> parameter</a></h2>
<p>Many functions in the API have an optional parameter named <code>networkConfig</code>. This parameter is used when a function needs to request an information from its peers.</p>
<p>Requesting an information from a peer involves sending a request to this peer. This request can fail for various reasons: the peer is non responsive, the peer is overwhelmed, the peer is malicious, the peer has a bug in its implementation, etc. Because the request can fail, multiple requests should be attempted towards different peers before the information retrieval fails altogether.</p>
<p>The passed passed for the <code>networkConfig</code> parameter is a struct defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;totalAttempts&quot;: ...,
    &quot;maxParallel&quot;: ...,
    &quot;timeoutMs&quot;: ...
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>totalAttempts</code> is an integer indicating the total number of peers to request for the information.</li>
<li><code>maxParallel</code> is an integer indicating the maximum number of requests to perform in parallel. A value of 0 is illegal.</li>
<li><code>timeoutMs</code> is an integer indicating the time, in milliseconds, after which a single request (towards one peer) is considered unsuccessful.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values can be tweaked depending on the urgency of the JSON-RPC function call. An important information should be queried with a low timeout and high number of <code>maxParallel</code>, while a low priority information should be queried with <code>maxParallel</code> equal to 1.
A JSON-RPC function call that is passed a <code>networkConfig</code> can take, in the worst case scenario, a bit more than <code>timeoutMs * totalAttempts / maxParallel</code> milliseconds.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server implementation is allowed and strongly encouraged to put hard a limit on the values in the <code>networkConfig</code>.</p>

<p>Functions with the <code>archive</code> prefix allow obtaining the state of the chain at any point in the present or in the past.</p>
<p>These functions are meant to be used to inspect the history of a chain. They can be used to access recent information as well, but JSON-RPC clients should keep in mind that the <code>chainHead</code> functions could be more appropriate.</p>
<p>These functions are typically expensive for a JSON-RPC server, because they likely have to perform either disk accesses or network requests. Consequently, JSON-RPC servers are encouraged to put a global limit on the number of concurrent calls to <code>archive</code>-prefixed functions.</p>

<p>This function is a simple getter. The JSON-RPC server is expected to keep in its memory the hash of the genesis block.</p>
<p>The value returned by this function must never change for the lifetime of the connection between the JSON-RPC client and server.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing an opaque value representing the operation.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC client must find the blocks (zero, one, or more) whose height is the one passed as parameter. If the <code>height</code> is inferior or equal to the finalized block height, then only finalized blocks must be fetched and returned.</p>
<p>This function will later generate a notification in the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;,
    &quot;method&quot;: &quot;archive_unstable_hashByHeightEvent&quot;,

        &quot;result&quot;: ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>result</code> can be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;done&quot;,
    &quot;output&quot;: [...]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>output</code> is an array of hexadecimal-encoded hashes corresponding to the blocks of this height that are known to the node. If the <code>height</code> is inferior or equal to the finalized block height, the array must contain either zero or one entry.</p>
<p>Only one notification will ever be generated.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Other events might be added in the future, such as reports on the progress of the query.</p>
<p><strong>Important implementation note</strong>: While it is possible for a light client to ask its peers which block hash corresponds to a certain height, it is at the moment impossible to obtain a proof of this. If a light client implements this JSON-RPC function, it must only look in its internal memory and <strong>not</strong> ask the network. Consequently, calling this function with a height more than a few blocks away from the finalized block height will always return zero blocks. Despite being currently useless, the <code>networkConfig</code> parameter is kept for the future.</p>

<h2 id="usage"><a class="header" href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p><em>This section contains a small beginner guide destined for JSON-RPC client users.</em></p>
<p>This beginner guide shows how to use the <code>chainHead</code> functions in order to know the value of a certain storage item.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Call <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> with <code>runtimeUpdates: true</code> to obtain a <code>followSubscriptionId</code>. This <code>followSubscriptionId</code> will need to be passed when calling most of the other <code>chainHead</code>-prefixed functions. If at any point in the future the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;stop&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;initialized&quot;}</code> notification with <code>subscriptionId</code> equal to your <code>followSubscriptionId</code>, store the value of <code>finalizedBlockHash</code> in that notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> with <code>hash</code> equal to the <code>finalizedBlockHash</code> you've just retrieved, <code>function</code> equal to <code>Metadata_metadata</code>, and an empty <code>callParameters</code>. <strong>TODO</strong> must check metadata api version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;inaccessible&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 3. If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;error&quot;}</code> notification, enter panic mode as the client software is incompatible with the current state of the blockchain. If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;disjoint&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 1. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;done&quot;}</code> notification, save the return value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The return value you've just saved is called the metadata, prefixed with its SCALE-compact-encoded length. You must decode and parse this metadata. How to do this is out of scope of this small guide. The metadata contains information about the layout of the storage of the chain. Inspect it to determine how to find the storage item you're looking for.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a value in the storage, call <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> with <code>hash</code> equal to <code>finalizedBlockHash</code>, <code>key</code> the desired key, and <code>type</code> equal to <code>value</code>. If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;disjoint&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 1. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;inaccessible&quot;}</code> notification, the value you're looking for is unfortunately inaccessible. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;done&quot;}</code> notification, you can find the desired value inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to maintain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">a <code>Set</code></a> of the blocks where the runtime changes. Whenever a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;newBlock&quot;}</code> notification is received with <code>subscriptionId</code> equal to your <code>followSubcriptionId</code>, and <code>newRuntime</code> is non-null, store the provided <code>blockHash</code> in this set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;finalized&quot;}</code> notification is received with <code>subscriptionId</code> equal to your <code>followSubcriptionId</code>, call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> once with your current <code>finalizedBlockHash</code> and once for each value in <code>finalizedBlocksHashes</code> except for the last one. The last value in <code>finalizedBlocksHashes</code> becomes your new <code>finalizedBlockHash</code>. If one or more entries of <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> is found in your <code>Set</code> (see step 6), remove them from the set and jump to step 3 as the metadata has likely been modified. Otherwise, jump to step 6.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that these steps are a bit complicated. Any serious user of the JSON-RPC interface is expected to implement high-level wrappers around the various JSON-RPC functions.</p>
<p>For example, if multiple storage values are desired, only step 6 should be repeated once per storage item. All other steps are application-wide.</p>

<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing an opaque value representing the operation.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must invoke the entry point of the runtime of the given block using the storage of the given block.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chainhead_unstable_follow"><a class="header" href="#chainhead_unstable_follow">chainHead_unstable_follow</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>runtimeUpdates</code>: A boolean indicating whether the events should report changes to the runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing an opaque value representing the subscription.</p>
<p>This functions lets the JSON-RPC client track the state of the head of the chain: the finalized, non-finalized, and best blocks.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1"><a class="header" href="#usage-1">Usage</a></h2>
<p>This function works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When called, returns an opaque <code>followSubscriptionId</code> that can used to match events and in various other <code>chainHead</code>-prefixed functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, generates an <code>initialized</code> notification (see below) containing the hash of the current finalized block, and, if <code>runtimeUpdates</code> is <code>true</code>, the runtime specification of the runtime of the current finalized block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards, generates one <code>newBlock</code> notification (see below) for each non-finalized block currently in the node's memory (including all forks), then a <code>bestBlockChanged</code> notification. The notifications must be sent in an ordered way such that the parent of each block either can be found in an earlier notification or is the current finalized block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a new block arrives, generates a <code>newBlock</code> notification. If the new block is also the new best block of the node, also generates a <code>bestBlockChanged</code> notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the node finalizes a block, generates a <code>finalized</code> notification indicating which blocks have been finalized and which blocks have been pruned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the node is overloaded and cannot avoid a gap in the notifications, or in case of a warp syncing, or if the maximum number of pinned blocks is reached (see below), generates a <code>stop</code> notification indicating that the subscription is now dead and must be re-created. No more notifications will be sent out on this subscription.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This list of notifications makes it very easy for a JSON-RPC client to follow just the best block updates (listening to just <code>bestBlockChanged</code> events) or follow just the finalized block updates (listening to just <code>initialized</code> and <code>finalized</code> events). It is however not possible to easily figure out whether the runtime has been modified when these updates happen. This is not problematic, as anyone using the JSON-RPC interface naively propably doesn't need to account for runtime changes anyway.</p>
<h2 id="the-runtimeupdates-parameter"><a class="header" href="#the-runtimeupdates-parameter">The <code>runtimeUpdates</code> parameter</a></h2>
<p>If the <code>runtimeUpdates</code> parameter is <code>true</code>, then blocks shouldn't (and can't) be reported to JSON-RPC clients before the JSON-RPC server has finished obtaining the runtime specification of the blocks that it reports. This includes the finalized block reported in the <code>initialized</code> event.</p>
<p>If <code>runtimeUpdates</code> is <code>false</code>, then the <code>initialized</code> event must be sent back quickly after the function returns. If <code>runtimeUpdates</code> is <code>true</code>, then the JSON-RPC server can take as much time as it wants to send back the <code>initialized</code> event.</p>
<p>For this reason, blocks might be reported more quickly when <code>runtimeUpdates</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is unlikely that high-level UIs built on top of a JSON-RPC client can do anything before the JSON-RPC server has access to the runtime. Consequently, they should consider the time before the <code>initialized</code> event is generated as a loading time. During this loading time, the JSON-RPC server might be performing downloads and CPU-intensive operations. This loading time can be considered as a replacement for the <code>isSyncing</code> field of the legacy <code>system_health</code> JSON-RPC call.</p>
<p>If a JSON-RPC client wants to be sure to receive an <code>initialized</code> event quickly but is also interested in the runtime, it is encouraged to create two subscriptions: one with <code>runtimeUpdates: true</code> and one with <code>runtimeUpdates: false</code>.</p>

<p><code>prunedBlocksHashes</code> contains, in no particular order, a list of blocks that are not descendants of the latest finalized block. These blocks will never be finalized and can be discarded.</p>
<p>All items in <code>finalizedBlocksHashes</code> and <code>prunedBlocksHashes</code> are guaranteed to have been reported through earlier <code>newBlock</code> events.</p>

<h3 id="stop"><a class="header" href="#stop">stop</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;stop&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>stop</code> event indicates that the JSON-RPC server was unable to provide a consistent list of the blocks at the head of the chain. This can happen because too many blocks have been pinned, because doing so would use an unreasonable amount of memory, or because a consensus mechanism creates a gap in the chain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In particular, warp syncing algorithms create a &quot;jump&quot; in the chain from a block to a much later block. Any subscription that is active when the warp syncing happens will receive a <code>stop</code> event.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated with this <code>subscriptionId</code>.</p>
<p>Calling <code>chainHead_unstable_unfollow</code> on a subscription that has produced a <code>stop</code> event is optional.</p>
<h2 id="pinning"><a class="header" href="#pinning">Pinning</a></h2>
<p>The current finalized block reported in the <code>initialized</code> event, and each subsequent block reported with a <code>newBlock</code> event, is automatically considered by the JSON-RPC server as <em>pinned</em>. A block is guaranteed to not leave the node's memory for as long as it is pinned, making it possible to call functions such as <code>chainHead_unstable_header</code> on it. Blocks must be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client by calling <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code>.</p>
<p>When a block is unpinned, on-going calls to <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> and <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> against this block will still finish normally.</p>
<p>A block is pinned only in the context of a specific subscription. If multiple <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions exist, then each <code>(subscription, block)</code> tuple must be unpinned individually. Blocks stay pinned even if they have been pruned from the blockchain, and must always be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server is strongly encouraged to enforce a limit to the maximum number of pinned blocks. If this limit is reached, it should then stop the subscription by emitting a <code>stop</code> event. This specification does not mention any specific limit, but it should be large enough for clients to be able to pin all existing non-finalized blocks and a few finalized blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A JSON-RPC client should call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> only after it is sure to no longer be interested in a certain block. This typically happens after the block has been finalized or pruned. There is no requirement to call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-subscriptions"><a class="header" href="#multiple-subscriptions">Multiple subscriptions</a></h2>
<p>If a JSON-RPC client maintains mutiple <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions at the same time, it has no guarantee that the blocks reported by the various subscriptions are the same. While the finalized blocks reported should eventually be the same, it is possible that in the short term some subscriptions lag behind others.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For example, imagine there exists two active <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions named A and B. Block N is announced on the peer-to-peer network and is announced to A. But then a sibling of block N gets finalized, leading to block N being pruned. Block N might never be announced to B.</p>

<p>The runtime is of type <code>invalid</code> if the JSON-RPC server considers the runtime as invalid, for example because the WebAssembly runtime code doesn't match its expectations.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable string indicating why the node considers it as invalid. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The typical situation where a node could consider the runtime as invalid is a light client after a warp syncing. The light client knows that it's its fault for considering the runtime as invalid, but it has no better way to handle this situation than to return an error through the JSON-RPC interface for the error to get shown to the user.</p>

<li>If the <code>followSubscriptionId</code> is dead, <em>null</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrieves the header of a pinned block.</p>
<p>This function should be seen as a complement to <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>, allowing the JSON-RPC client to retrieve more information about a block that has been reported. Use <code>archive_unstable_header</code> if instead you want to retrieve the header of an arbitrary block.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As explained in the documentation of <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>, the JSON-RPC server reserves the right to kill an existing subscription and unpin all its blocks at any moment in case it is overloaded or incapable of following the chain. If that happens, <code>chainHead_unstable_header</code> will return <code>null</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>followSubscriptionId</code>: An opaque string that was returned by <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>.</li>
<li><code>hash</code>: String containing an hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block whose storage to fetch.</li>

<li><code>networkConfig</code> (optional): Object containing the configuration of the networking part of the function. See <a href="api/./introduction.html">here</a> for details. Ignored if the JSON-RPC server doesn't need to perform a network request. Sensible defaults are used if not provided.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing an opaque value representing the operation.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must start obtaining the value of the entry with the given <code>key</code> (and possibly <code>childKey</code>) from the storage.</p>
<p>The operation will continue even if the given block is unpinned while it is in progress.</p>
<p>This function should be seen as a complement to <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>, allowing the JSON-RPC client to retrieve more information about a block that has been reported. Use <code>archive_unstable_storage</code> if instead you want to retrieve the storage of an arbitrary block.</p>
<p>For optimization purposes, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to wait a little bit (e.g. up to 100ms) before starting to try fulfill the storage request, in order to batch multiple storage requests together.</p>

<h3 id="validated"><a class="header" href="#validated">validated</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;validated&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>validated</code> event indicates that this transaction has been checked and is considered as valid by the runtime.</p>
<p>This transaction might still become invalid in the future, for example because a conflicting transaction is included in the chain in-between.</p>
<p>Multiple <code>validated</code> events can be generated during the lifetime of a transaction. If multiple <code>validated</code> events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last one.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In theory, this event could include a field indicating the block against which this transaction was validated.

}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>broadcasted</code> event indicates the number of other peers this transaction has been broadcasted to.</p>
<p><code>numPeers</code> is the total number of individual peers this transaction has been broadcasted to.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server doesn't (and can't) offer any guarantee that these peers have received the transaction or have saved it in their own transactions pool. In other words, no matter how large the value in <code>numPeers</code> is, no guarantee is offered that shutting down the local node will lead to the transaction being included.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In principle, a value of <code>numPeers</code> equal to 0 guarantees that shutting down the local node will lead to the transaction <em>not</em> being included, assuming that no other node has submitted the same transaction. However, because JSON-RPC servers are allowed to delay or skip events, the JSON-RPC client can never be sure that <code>numPeers</code> was still equal to 0 when shutting down the node.</p>
<p>If multiple <code>broadcasted</code> events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last.</p>

<h3 id="error-1"><a class="header" href="#error-1">error</a></h3>

    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>error</code> event indicates that an internal error within the client has happened.</p>
<p>Examples include: the runtime crashes, the runtime is missing the function to validate a transaction, the format of the value returned by the runtime is invalid, etc.</p>
<p>This typically indicates a bug in the runtime of the chain or an incompatibility between the client and the runtime of the chain, and there is nothing the end user can do to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The transaction that has been submitted will not be included in the chain by the local node, but it could be included by sending it via a different client implementation.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating what happened. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-1"><a class="header" href="#invalid-1">invalid</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;invalid&quot;,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>invalid</code> event indicates that the runtime has marked the transaction as invalid.</p>
<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons specific to the chain, such as a bad signature, bad nonce, not enough balance for fees, etc.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction is invalid. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h3 id="dropped"><a class="header" href="#dropped">dropped</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;dropped&quot;,
    &quot;broadcasted&quot;: true,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dropped</code> event indicates that the client wasn't capable of keeping track of this transaction.</p>
<p>If the <code>broadcasted</code> field is <code>true</code>, then this transaction has been sent to other peers and might still be included in the chain in the future. No guarantee is offered that the transaction will be included in the chain even if <code>broadcasted</code> is <code>true</code>. However, if <code>broadcasted</code> is <code>false</code>, then it is guaranteed that this transaction will not be included, unless it has been submitted in parallel on a different node.</p>
<p>This can happen for example if the JSON-RPC server's transactions pool is full, if the JSON-RPC server's resources have reached their limit, if the block the transaction is included in takes too long to be finalized, or the syncing requires a gap in the chain that prevents the JSON-RPC server from knowing whether the transaction has been included and/or finalized.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction has been dropped. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h2 id="transaction-state"><a class="header" href="#transaction-state">Transaction state</a></h2>
<p>One can build a mental model in order to understand which events can be generated. While a transaction is being watched, it has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>isValidated</code>: <code>yes</code> or <code>not-yet</code>. A transaction is initially <code>not-yet</code> validated. A <code>validated</code> event indicates that the transaction has now been validated. After a certain number of blocks or in case of retractation, a transaction automatically becomes <code>not-yet</code> validated and needs to be validated again. No event is generated to indicate that a transaction is no longer validated, however a <code>validated</code> event will be generated again when a transaction is validated again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code>: an optional block hash and index. A transaction is initially included in no block. It can automatically become included in a block of the best chain. A <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> event reports updates to this property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>numBroadcastedPeers</code>: <em>integer</em>. A transaction is initially broadcasted to 0 other peers. After a transaction is in the <code>isValidated: yes</code> and <code>bestChainBlockIncluded: none</code> states, the number of broadcaster peers can increase. This number never decreases and is never reset to 0, even if a transaction becomes <code>isValidated: not-yet</code>. The <code>broadcasted</code> event is used to report about updates to this value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these three properties are orthogonal to each other, except for the fact that <code>numBroadcastedPeers</code> can only increase when <code>isValidated: yes</code> and <code>bestChainBlockIncluded: none</code>. In particular, a transaction can be included in a block before being validated or broadcasted.</p>
<p>The <code>finalized</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>invalid</code>, and <code>dropped</code> event indicate that the transaction is no longer being watched. The state of the transaction is entirely discarded.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC servers are allowed to skip sending events as long as it properly keeps the JSON-RPC client up to date with the state of the transaction. In other words, multiple <code>validated</code>, <code>broadcasted</code>, or <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> events in a row might be merged into one.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to implement this properly, JSON-RPC servers should maintain a buffer of three notifications (one for each property), and overwrite any unsent notification with a more recent status update.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-9"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-9">Possible errors</a></h2>
<p>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the <code>transaction</code> parameter has an invalid format, but no error is produced if the bytes of the <code>transaction</code>, once decoded, are invalid. Instead, an <code>invalid</code> notification will be generated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="transaction_unstable_unwatch"><a class="header" href="#transaction_unstable_unwatch">transaction_unstable_unwatch</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subscription</code>: Opaque string equal to the value returned by <code>transaction_unstable_submitAndWatch</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>null</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This function does not remove the transaction from the pool. In other words, the node will still try to include the transaction in the chain. Having a function that removes the transaction from the pool would be almost useless, as the node might have already gossiped it to the rest of the network.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-10"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-10">Possible errors</a></h2>
<p>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the <code>subscriptionId</code> doesn't correspond to any active subscription.</p>
