# chainHead_unstable_follow

**Parameters**:

- `withRuntime`: A boolean indicating whether the events should report changes to the runtime.

**Return value**: String containing an opaque value representing the operation.

## Usage

This functions lets the JSON-RPC client track the state of the head of the chain: the finalized, non-finalized, and best blocks.

This function works as follows:

- When called, returns an opaque `followSubscription` that can used to match events and in various other `chainHead`-prefixed functions.

- Later, generates an `initialized` notification (see below) containing the hash of the current finalized block, and, if `withRuntime` is `true`, the runtime specification of the runtime of the current finalized block.

- Afterwards, generates one `newBlock` notification (see below) for each non-finalized block currently in the node's memory (including all forks), then a `bestBlockChanged` notification. The notifications must be sent in an ordered way such that the parent of each block either can be found in an earlier notification or is the current finalized block.

- When a new block arrives, generates a `newBlock` notification. If the new block is also the new best block of the node, also generates a `bestBlockChanged` notification.

- When the node finalizes a block, generates a `finalized` notification indicating which blocks have been finalized and which blocks have been pruned.

- If the node is overloaded and cannot avoid a gap in the notifications, or in case of a warp syncing, or if the maximum number of pinned blocks is reached (see below), generates a `stop` notification indicating that the subscription is now dead and must be re-created. No more notifications will be sent out on this subscription.

**Note**: This list of notifications makes it very easy for a JSON-RPC client to follow just the best block updates (listening to just `bestBlockChanged` events) or follow just the finalized block updates (listening to just `initialized` and `finalized` events). It is however not possible to easily figure out whether the runtime has been modified when these updates happen. This is not problematic, as anyone using the JSON-RPC interface naively propably doesn't need to account for runtime changes anyway.

Additionally, the `chainHead_unstable_body`, `chainHead_unstable_call`, and `chainHead_unstable_storage` JSON-RPC function might cause the subscription to produce additional notifications.

## The `withRuntime` parameter

If the `withRuntime` parameter is `true`, then blocks shouldn't (and can't) be reported to JSON-RPC clients before the JSON-RPC server has finished obtaining the runtime specification of the blocks that it reports. This includes the finalized block reported in the `initialized` event.

If `withRuntime` is `false`, then the `initialized` event must be sent back quickly after the function returns. If `withRuntime` is `true`, then the JSON-RPC server can take as much time as it wants to send back the `initialized` event.

For this reason, blocks might be reported more quickly when `withRuntime` is `false`.

**Note**: It is unlikely that high-level UIs built on top of a JSON-RPC client can do anything before the JSON-RPC server has access to the runtime. Consequently, they should consider the time before the `initialized` event is generated as a loading time. During this loading time, the JSON-RPC server might be performing downloads and CPU-intensive operations. This loading time can be considered as a replacement for the `isSyncing` field of the legacy `system_health` JSON-RPC call.

If a JSON-RPC client wants to be sure to receive an `initialized` event quickly but is also interested in the runtime, it is encouraged to create two subscriptions: one with `withRuntime: true` and one with `withRuntime: false`.

## Notifications format

This function will later generate one or more notifications in the following format:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "chainHead_unstable_follow",
    "params": {
        "subscription": "...",
        "result": ...
    }
}
```

Where `subscription` is the value returned by this function, and `result` can be one of:

### initialized

```json
{
    "event": "initialized",
    "finalizedBlockHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "finalizedBlockRuntime": ...
}
```

The `initialized` event is always the first event to be sent back, and is only ever sent back once per subscription.

`finalizedBlockRuntime` is present if and only if `withRuntime`, the parameter to this function, is `true`.

The format of `finalizedBlockRuntime` is described later down this page.

### newBlock

```json
{
    "event": "newBlock",
    "blockHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "parentBlockHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "newRuntime": ...
}
```

The `newBlock` indicates a new non-finalized block.

`parentBlockHash` is guaranteed to be equal either to the current finalized block hash, or to a block reported in an earlier `newBlock` event.

`newRuntime` must not be present if `withRuntime`, the parameter to this function, is `false`. `newRuntime` must be `null` if the runtime hasn't changed compared to its parent.

If present and non-null, the format of `newRuntime` is the same as the `finalizedBlockRuntime` field in the `initialized` event and is explained later down this page.

### bestBlockChanged

```json
{
    "event": "bestBlockChanged",
    "bestBlockHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

The `bestBlockChanged` event indicates that the given block is now considered to be the best block.

`bestBlockHash` is guaranteed to be equal either to the current finalized block hash, or to a block reported in an earlier `newBlock` event.

### finalized

```json
{
    "event": "finalized",
    "finalizedBlockHashes": [
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    ],
    "prunedBlockHashes": [
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    ]
}
```

The `finalized` event indicates that some of the blocks that have earlier been reported with `newBlock` events are now either finalized or no longer relevant.

`finalizedBlockHashes` contains a list of blocks that are now part of the finalized block, ordered by increasing block number. The last element in this list is the current finalized block.

`prunedBlockHashes` contains, in no particular order, a list of blocks that are not descendants of the latest finalized block. These blocks will never be finalized and can be discarded.

All items in `finalizedBlockHashes` and `prunedBlockHashes` are guaranteed to have been reported through earlier `newBlock` events.

The current best block, in other words the last block reported through a `bestBlockChanged` event, is guaranteed to either be the last item in `finalizedBlockHashes`, or to not be present in either `finalizedBlockHashes` or `prunedBlockHashes`.

### operationBodyDone

```json
{
    "event": "operationBodyDone",
    "operationId": ...,
    "value": [...]
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_body`.

The `operationBodyDone` event indicates that an operation started with `chainHead_unstable_body` was successful.

`value` is an array of strings containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded extrinsics found in the block.

**Note**: Note that the order of extrinsics is important. Extrinsics in the chain are uniquely identified by a `(blockHash, index)` tuple.

No more event will be generated with this `operationId`.

### operationCallDone

```json
{
    "event": "operationCallDone",
    "operationId": ...,
    "output": "0x0000000..."
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by`chainHead_unstable_call`.

The `operationCallDone` event indicates that an operation started with `chainHead_unstable_call` was successful.

`output` is the hexadecimal-encoded output of the runtime function call.

No more event will be generated with this `operationId`.

### operationStorageItems

```json
{
    "event": "operationStorageItems",
    "operationId": ...,
    "items": [
        {
            "key": "0x0000000...",
            "value": "0x0000000...",
            "hash": "0x0000000...",
            "closestDescendantMerkleValue": "0x000000..."
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

Yields one or more items that were found in the storage.

The `key` field is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded key of the item. This `key` is guaranteed to start with one of the `key`s provided as parameter to `chainHead_unstable_storage`.
If the `type` parameter was `"value"`, `"hash"`, `"closestDescendantMerkleValue"`, then it is also guaranteed to be equal to one of the `key`s provided as parameter to `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

In the situation where the `type` parameter was `"closestDescendantMerkleValue"`, the fact that `key` is equal to a `key` that was provided as parameter is necessary in order to avoid ambiguities when multiple `items` of type `"closestDescendantMerkleValue"` were requested.

The `value` field is set if this item corresponds to one of the requested items whose `type` was `"value"` or `"descendantsValues"`. The `value` field is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded value of the storage entry.

The `hash` field is set if this item corresponds to one of the requested items whose `type` was `"hash"` or `"descendantsHashes"`. The `hash` field is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the storage entry.

The `closestDescendantMerkleValue` field is set if this item corresponds to one of the requested items whose `type` was `"closestDescendantMerkleValue"`. The trie node whose Merkle value is indicated in `closestDescendantMerkleValue` is not indicated, as determining the key of this node might incur an overhead for the JSON-RPC server. The Merkle value is equal to either the node value or the hash of the node value, as defined in the [Polkadot specification](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-state#defn-merkle-value).

### operationWaitingForContinue

```json
{
    "event": "operationWaitingForContinue",
    "operationId": ...
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

The `waitingForContinue` event is generated after at least one `"operationStorageItems"` event has been generated, and indicates that the JSON-RPC client must call `chainHead_unstable_continue` before more events are generated.

This event only ever happens if the `type` of one of the `items` provided as a parameter to `chainHead_unstable_storage` was `descendantsValues` or `descendantsHashes`.

While the JSON-RPC server is waiting for a call to `chainHead_unstable_continue`, it can generate an `operationInaccessible` event in order to indicate that it can no longer proceed with the operation. If that is the case, the JSON-RPC client can simply try again.

### operationStorageDone

```json
{
    "event": "operationStorageDone",
    "operationId": ...
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

The `operationStorageDone` event indicates that an operation started with `chainHead_unstable_storage` went well and all result has been provided through `operationStorageItems` events in the past.

If no `operationStorageItems` event was yielded for this `operationId`, then the storage doesn't contain a value at the given key.

No more event will be generated with this `operationId`.

### operationInaccessible

```json
{
    "event": "operationInaccessible",
    "operationId": ...
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_body`, `chainHead_unstable_call`, or `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

The `operationInaccessible` event is produced if the JSON-RPC server was incapable of obtaining the storage items necessary for the given operation.

Contrary to the `operationError` event, repeating the same operation in the future might succeed.

No more event will be generated about this `operationId`.

### operationError

```json
{
    "event": "operationError",
    "operationId": ...,
    "error": "..."
}
```

`operationId` is a string returned by `chainHead_unstable_body`, `chainHead_unstable_call`, or `chainHead_unstable_storage`.

The `operationError` event indicates a problem during the operation. In the case of `chainHead_unstable_call`, this can include the function missing or a runtime panic. In the case of `chainHead_unstable_body` or `chainHead_unstable_storage`, this includes failing to parse the block header to obtain the extrinsics root hash or state root hash.

Contrary to the `operationInaccessible` event, repeating the same call in the future will not succeed.

`error` is a human-readable error message indicating why the call has failed. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

No more event will be generated about this `operationId`.

### stop

```json
{
    "event": "stop"
}
```

The `stop` event indicates that the JSON-RPC server was unable to provide a consistent list of the blocks at the head of the chain. This can happen because too many blocks have been pinned, because doing so would use an unreasonable amount of memory, or because a consensus mechanism creates a gap in the chain.

**Note**: In particular, warp syncing algorithms create a "jump" in the chain from a block to a much later block. Any subscription that is active when the warp syncing happens will receive a `stop` event.

No more event will be generated with this `subscription`.

Calling `chainHead_unstable_unfollow` on a subscription that has produced a `stop` event is optional.

## Pinning

The current finalized block reported in the `initialized` event, and each subsequent block reported with a `newBlock` event, is automatically considered by the JSON-RPC server as *pinned*. A block is guaranteed to not leave the node's memory for as long as it is pinned, making it possible to call functions such as `chainHead_unstable_header` on it. Blocks must be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client by calling `chainHead_unstable_unpin`.

When a block is unpinned, on-going calls to `chainHead_unstable_body`, `chainHead_unstable_call` and `chainHead_unstable_storage` against this block will still finish normally.

A block is pinned only in the context of a specific subscription. If multiple `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions exist, then each `(subscription, block)` tuple must be unpinned individually. Blocks stay pinned even if they have been pruned from the chain of blocks, and must always be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client.

The JSON-RPC server is strongly encouraged to enforce a limit to the maximum number of pinned blocks. If this limit is reached, it should then stop the subscription by emitting a `stop` event.
This specification does not mention any specific limit, but it must be large enough for clients to be able to pin all existing non-finalized blocks and the finalized blocks that have been reported in the previous few seconds or minutes.

**Note**: A JSON-RPC client should call `chainHead_unstable_unpin` only after it is sure to no longer be interested in a certain block. This typically happens after the block has been finalized or pruned. There is no requirement to call `chainHead_unstable_unpin` as quickly as possible.

**Note**: JSON-RPC server implementers should be aware that the number of non-finalized blocks might grow to become very large, for example in the case where the finality mechanism of the chain has an issue. When enforcing a limit to the number of pinned blocks, care must be taken to not prevent the API from being unusable in that situation. A good way to implement this limit is to limit only the number of pinned *finalized* blocks.

## Multiple subscriptions

The JSON-RPC server must accept at least 2 `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions per JSON-RPC client. Trying to open more might lead to a JSON-RPC error when calling `chainHead_unstable_follow`. In other words, as long as a JSON-RPC client starts 2 or fewer `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions, it is guaranteed that this return value will never happen.

If a JSON-RPC client maintains mutiple `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions at the same time, it has no guarantee that the blocks reported by the various subscriptions are the same. While the finalized blocks reported should eventually be the same, it is possible that in the short term some subscriptions lag behind others.

**Note**: For example, imagine there exists two active `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions named A and B. Block N is announced on the peer-to-peer network and is announced to A. But then a sibling of block N gets finalized, leading to block N being pruned. Block N might never be announced to B.

## About the runtime

The format of the `finalizedBlockRuntime` and `newRuntime` fields can be one of:

#### valid

```json
{
    "type": "valid",
    "spec": {
        "specName": ...,
        "implName": ...,
        "specVersion": ...,
        "implVersion": ...,
        "transactionVersion": ...,
        "apis": [...],
    }
}
```

In normal situations, the `type` is `valid`.

The fields of `spec` are:

- `specName`: Opaque string indicating the name of the chain.

- `implName`: Opaque string indicating the name of the implementation of the chain.

- `specVersion`: Opaque integer. The JSON-RPC client can assume that the call to `Metadata_metadata` will always produce the same output as long as the `specVersion` is the same.

- `implVersion`: Opaque integer. Whenever the runtime code changes in a backwards-compatible way, the `implVersion` is modified while the `specVersion` is left untouched.

- `transactionVersion`: Opaque integer. Necessary when building the bytes of a transaction. Transactions that have been generated with a different `transactionVersion` are incompatible.

- `apis`: Object containing a list of "entry point APIs" supported by the runtime. Each key is an opaque string indicating the API, and each value is an integer version number. Before making a runtime call (using `chainHead_unstable_call`), you should make sure that this list contains the entry point API corresponding to the call and with a known version number.

**Note**: In Substrate, the keys in the `apis` field consists of the hexadecimal-encoded 8-bytes blake2 hash of the name of the API. For example, the `TaggedTransactionQueue` API is `0xd2bc9897eed08f15`.

**Note**: The format of `apis` is not the same as in the legacy JSON-RPC API.

**Note**: The list of fields is only a subset of the list of so-called "runtime specification" found in the runtime. The fields that aren't useful from a JSON-RPC client perspective are intentionally not included.

#### Example value

```json
{
    "specName": "westend",
    "implName": "parity-westend",
    "specVersion": 9122,
    "implVersion": 0,
    "transactionVersion": 7,
    "apis": {
        "0xdf6acb689907609b": 3
        "0x37e397fc7c91f5e4": 1,
        "0x40fe3ad401f8959a": 5,
        "0xd2bc9897eed08f15": 3,
        "0xf78b278be53f454c": 2,
        "0xaf2c0297a23e6d3d": 1,
        "0x49eaaf1b548a0cb0": 1,
        "0x91d5df18b0d2cf58": 1,
        "0xed99c5acb25eedf5": 3,
        "0xcbca25e39f142387": 2,
        "0x687ad44ad37f03c2": 1,
        "0xab3c0572291feb8b": 1,
        "0xbc9d89904f5b923f": 1,
        "0x37c8bb1350a9a2a8": 1
    }
}
```

### invalid

```json
{
    "type": "invalid",
    "error": "..."
}
```

The runtime is of type `invalid` if the JSON-RPC server considers the runtime as invalid, for example because the WebAssembly runtime code doesn't match its expectations.

`error` is a human-readable string indicating why the node considers it as invalid. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

**Note**: The typical situation where a node could consider the runtime as invalid is a light client after a warp syncing. The light client knows that it's its fault for considering the runtime as invalid, but it has no better way to handle this situation than to return an error through the JSON-RPC interface for the error to get shown to the user.

## Possible errors

- A JSON-RPC error with error code `-32100` can be generated if the JSON-RPC client has already opened 2 or more `chainHead_unstable_follow` subscriptions.
