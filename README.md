This repository contains the specification of the JSON-RPC interface exposed by blockchain nodes in the Substrate ecosystem.

This specification aims at establishing a *lingua franca* between UIs, tools, etc. that would like to access a Substrate-based blockchain, and node client implementations that actually connect to the blockchain. Please note that it is, however, in no way mandatory for nodes to implement this specification in order to access a Substrate-based blockchain. As such, this specification is out of scope of, say, the Polkadot host specification.

## Contributing

This repository contains the specification.

It aims at being a reference point. If the text in this specification doesn't match what an implementation is doing, it is this specification that is correct.

You are encouraged to open issues if you see issues or would like to suggest improvements to this specification, or if some elements are missing clarity.
This specification can be modified (in a backwards-compatible way) by opening pull requests.
