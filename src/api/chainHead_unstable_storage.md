# chainHead_unstable_storage

**Parameters**:

- `followSubscription`: An opaque string that was returned by `chainHead_unstable_follow`.
- `hash`: String containing an hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block whose storage to fetch.
- `key`: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded key to fetch in the storage.
- `childTrie`: `null` for main storage look-ups, or a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded key of the key of the trie that `key` refers to.
- `networkConfig` (optional): Object containing the configuration of the networking part of the function. See [here](./api.md) for details. Ignored if the JSON-RPC server doesn't need to perform a network request. Sensible defaults are used if not provided.

**Return value**: String containing an opaque value representing the operation.

The JSON-RPC server must start obtaining the value of the entry with the given `key` from the main trie of the storage. If `childTrie` is not `null`, then the entry must instead be loaded from the child trie whose key is `childTrie`.

> **Note**: When `childTrie` is `null`, querying a `key` that starts with the ASCII-encoded string `:child_storage:` *must* produce a `null` value. This behavior is different from the behavior of the `ext_storage_get_version_1` host function in the client-host interface, where querying a key starts with the ASCII-encoded string `:child_storage:` might return the hash of the root of a child trie.

The operation will continue even if the given block is unpinned while it is in progress.

This function should be seen as a complement to `chainHead_unstable_follow`, allowing the JSON-RPC client to retrieve more information about a block that has been reported. Use `archive_unstable_storage` if instead you want to retrieve the storage of an arbitrary block.

For optimization purposes, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to wait a little bit (e.g. up to 100ms) before starting to try fulfill the storage request, in order to batch multiple storage requests together.

## Notifications format

This function will later generate notifications in the following format:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "chainHead_unstable_storageEvent",
    "params": {
        "subscription": "...",
        "result": ...
    }
}
```

Where `subscription` is equal to the value returned by this function, and `result` can be one of:

### done

```json
{
    "event": "done",
    "value": "0x0000000..."
}
```

The `done` event indicates that everything went well. The `value` field contains the requested value.

`value` is either `null` if the storage doesn't contain a value at the given key, or a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded value of the storage entry.

No more event will be generated with this `subscription`.

### inaccessible

```json
{
    "event": "inaccessible"
}
```

The `inaccessible` event indicates that the storage value has failed to be retrieved from the network.

No more event will be generated with this `subscription`.

### error

```json
{
    "event": "error",
    "error": "..."
}
```

The `error` event indicates a problem during the storage access, such as failing to parse the block header to obtain the state root hash.

Contrary to the `inaccessible` event, querying the same storage value again in the future will not succeed.

`error` is a human-readable error message indicating why the call has failed. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.

No more event will be generated with this `subscription`.

### disjoint

```json
{
    "event": "disjoint"
}
```

The `disjoint` event indicates that the provided `followSubscription` is invalid or stale.

No more event will be generated with this `subscription`.

## Possible errors

- A JSON-RPC error is generated if `type` isn't one of the allowed values (similarly to a missing parameter or an invalid parameter type).
- If the networking part of the behaviour fails, then a `{"event": "inaccessible"}` notification is generated (as explained above).
- If the `followSubscription` is invalid or stale, then a `{"event": "disjoint"}` notification is generated (as explained above).
- A JSON-RPC error is generated if the block hash passed as parameter doesn't correspond to any block that has been reported by `chainHead_unstable_follow`.
- A JSON-RPC error is generated if the `followSubscription` is valid but the block hash passed as parameter has already been unpinned.
