<p>This document contains the specification of the JSON-RPC interface exposed by blockchain nodes in the Substrate ecosystem.</p>
<p>This specification aims at establishing a <em>lingua franca</em> between UIs, tools, etc. that would like to access a Substrate-based blockchain, and node client implementations that actually connect to the blockchain. Please note that it is, however, in no way mandatory for nodes to implement this specification in order to access a Substrate-based blockchain. As such, this specification is out of scope of, say, the Polkadot host specification.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h1>
<p>The objective of this JSON-RPC interface is to accomodate multiple kinds of audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-user-facing applications that want to read and interact with the blockchain.</li>
<li>Node operators to want to make sure that their node is operating correctly, and perform some administrative operations such as rotating keys.</li>
<li>Core/parachain developers that want to manually look at the storage and figure out what is happening on the blockchain.</li>
<li>Oracles or bridges need to be able to read and interface with the blockchain.</li>
<li>Archivers want to look at past data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-user-facing-applications"><a class="header" href="#end-user-facing-applications">End-user-facing applications</a></h2>
<p>End-user-facing applications, such as a wallet or an unstoppable application, need to be able to read the storage of the blockchain and submit transactions.</p>
<p>These applications perform JSON-RPC function calls either against a node run locally by the end-user, or against a trusted JSON-RPC server. The locally-run node solution is strictly better for security and decentralization reasons, and we would like to encourage this. The trusted JSON-RPC server should be used as a back-up solution only in case it is not possible to run a node locally.</p>
<p>In order to be more user-friendly, a node run locally is very often a <em>light client</em> that doesn't hold the storage of the blockchain in its memory. The JSON-RPC functions are designed having in mind the fact that the target of the function calls might be a light client that doesn't have all the needed information immediately available.</p>
<p>End-user-facing applications generally rarely need to access older blocks. They usually care only about the storage of the finalized block and of the best block.</p>
<p>End-user-facing applications would normally not directly use the JSON-RPC interface, but an intermediary layer library built on top of the JSON-RPC interface. The JSON-RPC interface is a bit complicated to use, in a exchange for making functions more explicit and predictable.</p>
<p>An end-user-facing application is typically a website that the end-user visits. Both in the case of a locally-run node and in the case of a remote node, the JSON-RPC server is subject to attacks by malicious applications as an application can ask the end-user's browser to send millions of requests to the server. For this reason, it is important for the JSON-RPC server to resist to some degree to attacks (both DoS attacks and vulnerabilities), and thus for the JSON-RPC interface to not require behaviors that contradict DoS resilience.</p>
<p>When calls are made against a node run locally, the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important. However, the JSON-RPC functions have a very precise behavior, in order to avoid situations where an ambiguity in what the JSON-RPC client desires leads the JSON-RPC server to use more bandwidth than is strictly required.</p>
<p>When calls are made against a trusted JSON-RPC server, the bandwidth consumption and latency are more important. However, one should keep in mind that we would like to discourage trusted JSON-RPC servers.</p>
<h2 id="node-operators"><a class="header" href="#node-operators">Node operators</a></h2>
<p>DevOps that are administering a node (be it a full node, a validator, or an archive node) want to be able to know whether their node is operating properly, and might want to change some configuration options while the node is running.</p>
<p>DevOps are usually familiar with bash scripts. In order to make their life easier, the functions in the JSON-RPC interface that are relevant to them are usable with just a few CLI tools. The <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat">websocat</a> CLI tool is probably the easiest way to communicate over a WebSocket connection at the time of writing of this document.</p>
<p>DevOps shouldn't have to use unstable functions when writing bash scripts. They want to be able to run scripts automatically in the background without them breaking. As such, the functions that they need are stable.</p>
<p>Since scripts usually run on the same machine or a machine in the same data center as the target of the JSON-RPC function calls, the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important for this usage.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-developers"><a class="header" href="#debugging-developers">Debugging developers</a></h2>
<p>Core/parachain developers want to be able to look at the on-chain storage or the internal state of a node, for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>When debugging the chain or the node implementation, developers rarely care about the stability of the function they use. They perform manual function calls using some tools (either a UI or a CLI tool) and throw away the function call once they're finished debugging.</p>
<p>In order to accomodate this audience, it should be relatively easy to perform a JSON-RPC function call manually, and developers should be able to easily add to the interface new semi-temporary JSON-RPC functions specific to their debugging needs.</p>
<p>The target of the JSON-RPC function calls is either their own node, or a specific node that has encountered an issue, and the bandwidth consumption and latency of the JSON-RPC functions isn't very important for this usage.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-and-bridges"><a class="header" href="#oracles-and-bridges">Oracles and bridges</a></h2>
<p>Oracles and bridges consist for example in cryptocurencies exchanges or any software that programmatically interacts with a chain.</p>
<p>Contrary to end-user-facing applications, no human is interfacing directly or indirectly with the JSON-RPC client. Everything is automatic.
However, everything said in the section about end-user-facing applications also applies here.</p>
<h2 id="archivers"><a class="header" href="#archivers">Archivers</a></h2>
<p>Archivers are websites or applications that want to look at the past state of the chain.</p>
<p>In order to accomodate this audience, the JSON-RPC interface should provide functions that lets you access any block of the chain, and the storage of the chain at any block.
Note that pruned blocks, in other words blocks that aren't descendants of the latest finalized blocks, are out of scope of this use case as inspecting them isn't considered useful for archiving purposes.</p>
<p>Apart from this difference, this category is a mix between &quot;end-user-facing applications&quot; and &quot;node operators&quot;.</p>
<p>Archivers expect the JSON-RPC function calls to be stable and easy to use. They normally don't pay too much attention to performances and don't optimize their code, as long as everything is relatively fast.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-json-rpc"><a class="header" href="#why-json-rpc">Why JSON-RPC?</a></h1>
<p>The JSON-RPC protocol has been chosen over other protocols such as gRPC due to its simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Protocol specification formats such as https://open-rpc.org/ have been considered, but are unfortunately lacking the capabilities to describe subscriptions, and their interest is therefore limited.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grouping-functions-and-node-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#grouping-functions-and-node-capabilities">Grouping functions and node capabilities</a></h1>
<p>All JSON-RPC functions in this interface are distributed between so-called groups.</p>
<p>The group a JSON-RPC function belongs to is indicated by the <code>prefix_</code> in its name. This prefix includes a version number. For example, in <code>foo_v1_bar</code> the prefix is <code>foo_v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="node-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#node-capabilities">Node capabilities</a></h2>
<p>This JSON-RPC interface is intended to be implemented on various types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full nodes, which hold in their database all block headers and bodies, plus the storage of recent blocks.</li>
<li>Light clients, which only know the headers of recent blocks.</li>
<li>Archive nodes, which hold in their database all block headers, bodies, and storage of every past block.</li>
<li>Plain databases that aren't actually connected to the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>These various node implementations have different capabilities, and it is normal for some implementations to only support some functions and not others. It doesn't make sense for example for a light client to support a function that rotates keys.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC server must always support the <code>rpc_methods</code> function, and clients should use this function to determine which other functions are supported.</p>
<p>In order to not introducing too much confusion and complexity, supporting a group of functions is all or nothing. Either all functions in a group are supported, or none of them. This rule reduces the complexity that a JSON-RPC client has to face to determine what a JSON-RPC server is capable of.</p>

<p>A group name must always include a version number. This version number is part of the group name it self, and consequently <code>foo_v1</code> and <code>foo_v2</code> should be considered as two completely separate, unrelated, groups.</p>
<p>As explained in the previous section, some nodes might support some groups and not others. For example, some nodes might support only <code>foo_v1</code>, some others only <code>foo_v2</code>, some others both, and some others neither.</p>
<p>Each group must be self-contained, and not build on top of functions of a different group. For example, <code>foo_v1_start</code> can only be stopped with <code>foo_v1_stop</code> and <code>foo_v2_start</code> can only be stopped with <code>foo_v2_stop</code>. <code>foo_v1_stop</code> must not be able to stop <code>foo_v2_start</code> and vice versa. For this reason, if the version number of a group is increased, all functions that are still relevant should be duplicated in the new group.</p>
<p>Having a clear version number makes it clear for developers that some functions (with a higher version number) are preferred over some others. For example, when <code>foo_v2</code> is introduced, developers automatically understand that <code>foo_v1</code> is soft-deprecated.</p>
<h2 id="unstable-functions"><a class="header" href="#unstable-functions">Unstable functions</a></h2>
<p>No guarantee is offered as to the stability of functions with <code>unstable</code> as their version number. They can disappear, get renamed, change parameters, or change return value without any warning.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, higher-level applications should not rely on unstable functions. Please open an issue in this repository if some critical feature is missing or is only covered by an unstable function.</p>
<p>The presence of unstable functions in the interface exposed by a JSON-RPC server is not a problem by itself. Not all functions are destined to be stabilized, and it is normal for some functions to remain unstable forever.</p>
<p>Unstable functions are especially useful for core/parachain developers to add debugging utilities to their client implementation. For example, if a developer wants to investigate the list of Grandpa votes, they could introduce a function named <code>grandpa_unstable_votes</code>.</p>
<p>It is expected that all new functions added to this interface go through a testing phase during which they're unstable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dos-attacks-resilience"><a class="header" href="#dos-attacks-resilience">DoS attacks resilience</a></h1>
<p><em>This page is at the same time a small guide explaining how to handle DoS attacks, and explains the motivation behind some design decisions.</em></p>
<p>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack consists in consuming all the resources (bandwidth, disk I/O, CPU, or memory) of the target in order to prevent the target from properly serving legitimate users. It is possible to mitigate a DoS attack by identifying the attackers and filtering them out, but this is never done by the final JSON-RPC server that actually processes requests. From the point of view of the final JSON-RPC server, a DoS attack is the same thing as being under very heavy load.</p>
<p>Because the resources available to the target are bounded, it is fundamentally impossible to claim to be able to resist to all DoS attacks. It is, however, possible to optimize and properly distribute resources consumption in order to increase the load that the target is capable of handling.</p>
<p>Additionally, and maybe more importantly, it is important to guarantee a good quality of service even when under heavy load.</p>
<h2 id="bounded-queues"><a class="header" href="#bounded-queues">Bounded queues</a></h2>
<p>In order to provide a good quality of service, the time between the moment a request is received by the server and the moment the response is sent back must be short. In order to achieve this, the CPU operations and I/O operations needed to handle the request must not take too much time. The only way to guarantee this is by limiting the number of CPU or I/O operations that can be performed concurrently. As an example, if you try to read 5000 files at once, some of these file reads will take a long time, and the only way to guarantee that any file read is always short is to not start too many at the same time.</p>
<p>This is generally achieved by creating a certain number of threads (lightweight or not) dedicated to handling a specific CPU or I/O operation. By doing so, you are guaranteed that the number of these CPU or I/O operations that are being executed simultaneously will never exceed the number of threads dedicated to them. When an operation needs to be performed, it is put in a FIFO queue in order to be picked up by these threads. It is important for the sizes of all queues to be bounded, in order for memory usage to be bounded as well, and as otherwise operations could take a long time being stuck in a queue.</p>
<p>Queues should be bounded such that, even when they are nearly full, the time between the moment when an operation enters the queue and the moment when it is processed is reasonable. A bound that is too low can potentially lead to a decrease in performance due to an excess of context switches, but this is in practice rarely a problem.</p>
<p>When a queue of operations is full, the dispatcher should simply wait for some space to be available. This is called <em>back-pressure</em>, as the dispatcher is intentionally slowed down as well. If the dispatcher is itself responsible for processing some operations in a queue, this processing is paused, and that queue is slowed down as well, which might cause more back-pressure to be propagated elsewhere.</p>
<p>This back-pressure must be propagated all the way to the TCP socket. When the code receiving requests from the TCP socket is unable to move forward because a queue is full, it should in turn stop receiving data from the TCP socket. This will in turn cause the Linux kernel to not increase the TCP window size, which propagates the back-pressure to the JSON-RPC client, slowing down this JSON-RPC client.</p>
<p>In multiplexing situations, where multiple threads (lightweight or not) all try to insert elements in a single bounded queue, it is important for the distribution of items to have an acceptable distribution. It must not happen that some threads are able to insert elements very quickly while some others need to sleep for a long time before their element is inserted.</p>
<p>Thanks to all these mechanisms, the amount of CPU and I/O consumed by all JSON-RPC clients connected to the server combined is bounded and uniformly distributed between each JSON-RPC client, guaranteeing that they are equally slowed down. In order to guarantee a good quality of service to these clients, the final step is simply to limit the number of JSON-RPC clients that are allowed to connect. The precise limit depends on the capabilities of the machine running the JSON-RPC server.</p>
<h2 id="dispatching-a-notification-shouldnt-wait"><a class="header" href="#dispatching-a-notification-shouldnt-wait">Dispatching a notification shouldn't wait</a></h2>
<p>Some JSON-RPC functions in the API let clients subscribe to some events, such as a new block, meaning that the server must send a notification to the client when that specific event happens.</p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that these events, generated by the blockchain node, shouldn't be back-pressured. We do not want to slow down for example the reception of blocks by the node because the JSON-RPC server isn't capable of following the rhythm.</p>
<p>The events coming from the blockchain node can be seen as a stream. This stream can briefly be back-pressured, but ideally as little as possible. Whatever threads are on the receiving side of this stream of events should therefore consist only of CPU-only non-blocking operations.</p>
<p>However, sending a message to a JSON-RPC client might take a long time, in case the client has (intentionally or not) little bandwidth. The threads that are receiving the stream of events should never wait for a client to be ready to accept more data before sending a notification to it. If the client isn't ready, then the notification must either be added to a send queue or simply discarded. Because queues must be bounded, it is unavoidable to sometimes have to discard some notifications.</p>
<p>Consequently, all functions that consist in sending notifications must be designed having in mind that the queue of notifications to send out must be bounded to a certain value. For example, the queue of notifications for <code>transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch</code> must have a size of 3. When the queue is full, new notifications must overwrite the notifications already in the queue. The design of all JSON-RPC functions should take into account the fact that this shouldn't result in a loss of important information for the JSON-RPC client.</p>
<h2 id="distinguishing-between-light-and-heavy-calls"><a class="header" href="#distinguishing-between-light-and-heavy-calls">Distinguishing between light and heavy calls</a></h2>
<p>When implementing bounded queues, one should avoid a situation where some elements in the queue are very quick to be processed while some others very slow.</p>
<p>During normal operations one will decide on the size of the queue and number of processing threads based on the average time it takes to process a queue element, but during a DoS attack the attacker can deliberately push a larger number of elements that are heavy to process. For example, with a single queue of incoming JSON-RPC requests, an attacker can intentionally submit requests that take a long time to process, in order to fill the queue more quickly.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to sometimes split some queues, where light operations go on one queue and heavy operations on a different one.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why JSON-RPC functions are split by groups. In particular, the <code>archive</code>-prefixed JSON-RPC functions are, due to their disk access, considered as heavy and should be processed on a different queue than the other JSON-RPC functions. Under heavy load, it is likely that the processing of <code>archive</code>-prefixed JSON-RPC functions will be slowed down a lot, while the processing of other functions will be less impacted.</p>
<h2 id="enforced-limits"><a class="header" href="#enforced-limits">Enforced limits</a></h2>
<p>In order to limit the memory consumption and the latency of processing requests, it is important that requests that involve storing some state on the JSON-RPC server in the long term are subject to limits.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of JSON-RPC clients simultaneously connected must be bounded.</li>
<li>The number of active subscriptions (i.e. where the server sends a notification to the client when something happens) must be bounded.</li>
<li>The number of pinned blocks (in the context of <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>) must be bounded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The limits on the number of active subscriptions and pinned block should be enforced per client, as it would be undesirable to limit the number of subscriptions/pinned blocks available to some clients just because other clients are using a lot of them. Since the number of clients is bounded, enforcing these limits per client also automatically enforces these limits globally.</p>
<p>Note that the limit on the number of JSON-RPC clients simultaneously connected should be enforced by rejecting new clients with a 503 status code, rather than for example closing the TCP socket altogether. This makes it possible for other software in front of the JSON-RPC server, such as a load balancer, to understand what the problem is.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="load-balancers"><a class="header" href="#load-balancers">Load balancers</a></h1>
<p>In case of a publicly-accessible JSON-RPC server, it is unlikely for a single server to be able to handle the load of all the end users running JSON-RPC clients.</p>
<p>For this reason, the JSON-RPC interface is suitable for load balancer. A single load balancer can serve all the requests and dispatch them to multiple nodes.</p>
<p>With the exception of the JSON-RPC functions prefixed with ̀<code>sudo</code>, none of the JSON-RPC functions require stick sessions. In other words, if a JSON-RPC client disconnects from the load balancer, then reconnects, the load balancer can wire the connection to a different underlying server than the one it previously used. However, as long as a JSON-RPC client is connected, all its messages must be redirected to the same underlying JSON-RPC server. The underlying server can change only after a disconnect/reconnect.</p>
<h2 id="unsafe-json-rpc-functions"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-json-rpc-functions">Unsafe JSON-RPC functions</a></h2>
<p>In the legacy JSON-RPC interface, a flag on the server renders some JSON-RPC functions inaccessible. This is important in order to prevent the general public from accessing the node's configuration and sensitive data. In this new JSON-RPC interface, all the functions that shouldn't be publicly-accessible are prefixed with <code>sudo</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to insert proxies that filter incoming requests. All such proxy has to do is parse JSON-RPC requests and detect whether the function name starts with a prefix that isn't <code>sudo_</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, however, such proxy doesn't seem to exist, and JSON-RPC server implementations should continue to provide a configuration option (such as a CLI flag) to disable <code>sudo</code>-prefixed functions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="api-specification"><a class="header" href="#api-specification">API specification</a></h1>
<p>Note that all parameters are mandatory unless specified otherwise. All functions support two ways of calling them: either by passing an array with an ordered list of parameters, or by passing an object where parameters are named.</p>
<p>Any missing parameter, or parameter with an invalid format, should result in a JSON-RPC error being returned, as described in the JSON-RPC specification.</p>

<p>Functions with the <code>archive</code> prefix allow obtaining the state of the chain at any point in the present or in the past.</p>
<p>These functions are meant to be used to inspect the history of a chain. They can be used to access recent information as well, but JSON-RPC clients should keep in mind that the <code>chainHead</code> functions could be more appropriate.</p>
<p>These functions are typically expensive for a JSON-RPC server, because they likely have to perform either disk accesses or network requests. Consequently, JSON-RPC servers are encouraged to put a global limit on the number of concurrent calls to <code>archive</code>-prefixed functions.</p>
<h1 id="usage"><a class="header" href="#usage">Usage</a></h1>
<p>The JSON-RPC server exposes a finalized block height, which can be retrieved by calling <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>.</p>
<p>Call <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> in order to obtain the hash of a block by its height.</p>
<p>If the height passed to <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> is inferior or equal to the value returned by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>, then it is always guaranteed that there is exactly one block with this hash.
The JSON-RPC client can then call <code>archive_unstable_header</code>, <code>archive_unstable_body</code>, <code>archive_unstable_storage</code>, and <code>archive_unstable_call</code> in order to obtain details about the block with this hash. It is always guaranteed to return a value.</p>
<p>If the height passed to <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> is strictly superior to the value returned by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>, then <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> might return zero, one, or more blocks. Furthermore, the list of blocks being returned can change at any point. It is also possible to call <code>archive_unstable_header</code>, <code>archive_unstable_body</code>, <code>archive_unstable_storage</code>, and <code>archive_unstable_call</code> on these blocks, but these functions might return <code>null</code> even if their hash was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="archive_unstable_body"><a class="header" href="#archive_unstable_body">archive_unstable_body</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hash</code>: String containing a hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block whose body will be retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: If a block with that hash is found, an array of strings containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-codec-encoded transactions in that block. If no block with that hash is found, <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height inferior or equal to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then calling this method multiple times is guaranteed to always return non-null and always the same result.</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height strictly superior to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then the block might &quot;disappear&quot; and calling this function might return <code>null</code> at any point.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="archive_unstable_call"><a class="header" href="#archive_unstable_call">archive_unstable_call</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hash</code>: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block to make the call against.</li>
<li><code>function</code>: Name of the runtime entry point to call as a string.</li>
<li><code>callParameters</code>: Hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded value to pass as input to the runtime function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no block with that <code>hash</code> exists, <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>If the call was successful, <code>{ &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;value&quot;: ... }</code> where the <code>value</code> is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded value returned by the runtime.</li>
<li>If the call wasn't successful, <code>{ &quot;success&quot;: false, &quot;error&quot;: ... }</code> where the <code>error</code> is a human-readable message indicating the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must invoke the entry point of the runtime of the given block using the storage of the given block.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The runtime is still allowed to call host functions with side effects, however these side effects must be discarded. For example, a runtime function call can try to modify the storage of the chain, but this modification must not be actually applied. The only motivation for performing a call is to obtain the return value.</p>
<p>In situations where the provided runtime function doesn't exist, or the runtime crashes, or similar, an error is returned. The <code>error</code> isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height inferior or equal to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then calling this method multiple times is guaranteed to always return non-null and always the same result (except for the <code>error</code> message which is allowed to change).</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height strictly superior to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then the block might &quot;disappear&quot; and calling this function might return <code>null</code> at any point.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="archive_unstable_finalizedheight"><a class="header" href="#archive_unstable_finalizedheight">archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>: <em>none</em></p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: An integer height of the current finalized block of the chain.</p>
<p>The value returned by this function must only ever increase over time. In other words, if calling this function returns <code>N</code>, then calling it again later must return a value superior or equal to <code>N</code>.</p>
<p>When implemented on a load balancer, keep in mind that the other functions of the <code>archive</code> namespace must always return the same value when the block's height is inferior or equal to the finalized block height indicated by this function. One possible implementation strategy is for this function to call <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code> on every node being load balanced and return the smallest value.</p>
<p>This function is expected to be called rarely by the JSON-RPC client. This function exists in order to give an indication of which blocks are accessible, and not for JSON-RPC clients to follow the finalized block. The <code>archive</code> namespace isn't meant to follow the head of the chain, and <code>chainHead</code> should be used instead in that situation.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>: <em>none</em></p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the genesis block of the chain.</p>
<p>This function is a simple getter. The JSON-RPC server is expected to keep in its memory the hash of the genesis block.</p>
<p>The value returned by this function must never change for the lifetime of the connection between the JSON-RPC client and server.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>height</code>: Integer representing the height of the block.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: Array (possibly empty) of strings containing a hexadecimal-encoded hash of a block header.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC client must find the blocks (zero, one, or more) whose height is the one passed as parameter. If the <code>height</code> is inferior or equal to the finalized block height, then only finalized blocks must be fetched and returned.</p>
<p>It returns an array of hexadecimal-encoded hashes corresponding to the blocks of this height that are known to the node.
If the <code>height</code> is inferior or equal to the finalized block height, the array must contain exactly one entry. Furthermore, calling this function multiple times with the same <code>height</code> inferior or equal to the finalized block height must always return the same result.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: If a block with that hash is found, a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-codec encoding header of the block. If no block with that hash is found, <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height inferior or equal to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then calling this method multiple times is guaranteed to always return non-null and always the same result.</p>
<p>If the block was previously returned by <code>archive_unstable_hashByHeight</code> at a height strictly superior to the current finalized block height (as indicated by <code>archive_unstable_finalizedHeight</code>), then the block might &quot;disappear&quot; and calling this function might return <code>null</code> at any point.</p>

<p>The trie node whose Merkle value is indicated in <code>closestDescendantMerkleValue</code> is not indicated, as determining the key of this node might incur an overhead for the JSON-RPC server.

<p>For each item in <code>items</code>, the JSON-RPC server must start obtaining the value of the entry with the given <code>key</code> from the storage, either from the main trie or from <code>childTrie</code>. If <code>type</code> is <code>descendantsValues</code> or <code>descendantsHashes</code>, then it must also obtain the values of all the descendants of the entry.</p>
<p>For the purpose of storage requests, the trie root hash of the child tries of the storage can be found in the main trie at keys starting the bytes of the ASCII string <code>:child_storage:</code>. This behaviour is consistent with all the other storage-request-alike mechanisms of Polkadot and Substrate-based chains, such as host functions or libp2p network requests.</p>
<p>If the height of the block hash provided is less than or equal to the current finalized block height (which can be obtained via archive_unstable_finalizedHeight), then calling this method with the same parameters will always return the same response.
If the height of the block hash provided is greater than the current finalized block height, then the block might be pruned at any time and calling this method may return null.</p>
<p>This function should be used when the target block is older than the blocks reported by <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>.
Use <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> if instead you want to retrieve the storage of a block obtained by the <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>items</code> contains multiple identical or overlapping queries, the JSON-RPC server can choose whether to merge or not the items in the result. For example, if the request contains two items with the same key, one with <code>hash</code> and one with <code>value</code>, the JSON-RPC server can choose whether to generate two <code>item</code> objects, one with the value and one with the hash, or only a single <code>item</code> object with both <code>hash</code> and <code>value</code> set.</p>
<p>It is allowed (but discouraged) for the JSON-RPC server to provide the same information multiple times in the result, for example providing the <code>value</code> field of the same <code>key</code> twice. Forcing the JSON-RPC server to de-duplicate items in the result might lead to unnecessary overhead.</p>

<p>Functions with the <code>chainHead</code> prefix allow tracking the head of the chain (in other words, the latest new and finalized blocks) and their storage.</p>
<p>The most important function in this category is <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>. It is the first function that is the user is expected to call, before (almost) any other. <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> returns the current list of blocks that are near the head of the chain, and generates notifications about new blocks. The <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_header</code> and <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> functions can be used to obtain more details about the blocks that have been reported by <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>.</p>
<p>These functions are the functions most of the JSON-RPC clients will most commonly use. A JSON-RPC server implementation is encouraged to prioritize serving these functions over other functions, and to put pinned blocks in a quickly-accessible cache.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1"><a class="header" href="#usage-1">Usage</a></h2>
<p><em>This section contains a small beginner guide destined for JSON-RPC client users.</em></p>
<p>This beginner guide shows how to use the <code>chainHead</code> functions in order to know the value of a certain storage item.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Call <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> with <code>withRuntime: true</code> to obtain a <code>followSubscription</code>. This <code>followSubscription</code> will need to be passed when calling most of the other <code>chainHead</code>-prefixed functions. If at any point in the future the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;stop&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;initialized&quot;}</code> notification with <code>subscription</code> equal to your <code>followSubscription</code>, store the value of <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> found in that notification. If <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> contains multiple values, you should use the last entry. The last entry corresponds to the <em>current finalized block</em> of the chain. You must then call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code>, passing the <code>followSubscription</code> and each of the other values in <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the <code>finalizedBlockRuntime</code> field of the event contains a field <code>type</code> containing <code>valid</code>, and that the <code>spec</code> -&gt; <code>apis</code> object contains a key <code>0xd2bc9897eed08f15</code> whose value is <code>3</code>. This verifies that the runtime of the chain supports the <code>Metadata_metadata</code> function that we will call below (<code>0xd2bc9897eed08f15</code> is the 64bits blake2 hash of the ASCII string <code>Metadata</code>). If it is not the case, enter panic mode as the client software is incompatible with the current state of the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> with <code>hash</code> equal to the <em>current finalized block</em> you've just retrieved, <code>function</code> equal to <code>Metadata_metadata</code>, and an empty <code>callParameters</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationInaccessible&quot;}</code> notification, jump back to step 4 to try again. If the JSON-RPC server sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationError&quot;}</code> notification, enter panic mode. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationCallDone&quot;}</code> notification, save the return value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The return value you've just saved is called the metadata, prefixed with its SCALE-compact-encoded length. You must decode and parse this metadata. How to do this is out of scope of this small guide. The metadata contains information about the layout of the storage of the chain. Inspect it to determine how to find the storage item you're looking for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain a value in the storage, call <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> with <code>hash</code> equal to the <em>current finalized block</em>, <code>key</code> the desired key, and <code>type</code> equal to <code>value</code>. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationInaccessible&quot;}</code> notification, the value you're looking for is unfortunately inaccessible and you can either try again or give up. If the JSON-RPC server instead sends back a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationStorageItems&quot;}</code> notification, you can find the desired value inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to maintain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">a <code>Set</code></a> of the blocks where the runtime changes. Whenever a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;newBlock&quot;}</code> notification is received with <code>subscription</code> equal to your <code>followSubcriptionId</code>, and <code>newRuntime</code> is non-null, store the provided <code>blockHash</code> in this set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;finalized&quot;}</code> notification is received with <code>subscription</code> equal to your <code>followSubcriptionId</code>, call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> with the <em>current finalized block</em> hash, the <code>prunedBlockHashes</code>, and with each value in <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> of the <code>finalized</code> event except for the last entry. The last entry in <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> becomes your new <em>current finalized block</em>. If one or more entries of <code>finalizedBlockHashes</code> are found in your <code>Set</code> (see step 7), remove them from the set and jump to step 3 as the metadata has likely been modified. Otherwise, jump to step 7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that these steps are a bit complicated. Any serious user of the JSON-RPC interface is expected to implement high-level wrappers around the various JSON-RPC functions.</p>
<p>For example, if multiple storage values are desired, only step 7 should be repeated once per storage item. All other steps are application-wide.</p>

<h3 id="limitreached"><a class="header" href="#limitreached">LimitReached</a></h3>
<pre><code>{

<p>This return value indicates the request couldn't be started because the server is overloaded, or that the <code>followSubscription</code> is invalid or stale.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC client should try again after an on-going <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, or <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> operation finishes.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must accept at least 16 concurrent operations for any given <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscription. In other words, as long as the JSON-RPC client makes sure that no more than 16 operations are in progress at any given item, it is guaranteed that all of its operations will be accepted by the JSON-RPC server.
For this purpose, each item requested through <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> counts as one operation, and each call to <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code> and <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> counts as one operation.</p>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must start obtaining the body (in other words the list of transactions) of the given block.</p>
<p>The progress of the operation is indicated through <code>operationBodyDone</code>, <code>operationInaccessible</code>, or <code>operationError</code> notifications generated on the corresponding <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscription.</p>
<p>The operation continues even if the target block is unpinned with <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code>.</p>
<p>This function should be seen as a complement to <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>, allowing the JSON-RPC client to retrieve more information about a block that has been reported. Use <code>archive_unstable_body</code> if instead you want to retrieve the body of an arbitrary block.</p>

<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must invoke the entry point of the runtime of the given block using the storage of the given block.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The runtime is still allowed to call host functions with side effects, however these side effects must be discarded. For example, a runtime function call can try to modify the storage of the chain, but this modification must not be actually applied. The only motivation for performing a call is to obtain the return value.</p>
<p>The progress of the operation is indicated through <code>operationCallDone</code>, <code>operationInaccessible</code>, or <code>operationError</code> notifications generated on the corresponding <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscription.</p>

<h2 id="usage-2"><a class="header" href="#usage-2">Usage</a></h2>
<p>This functions lets the JSON-RPC client track the state of the head of the chain: the finalized, non-finalized, and best blocks.</p>
<p>This function works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When called, returns an opaque <code>followSubscription</code> that can used to match events and in various other <code>chainHead</code>-prefixed functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, generates an <code>initialized</code> notification (see below) containing the hashes of the latest finalized blocks, and, if <code>withRuntime</code> is <code>true</code>, the runtime specification of the runtime of the current finalized block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards, generates one <code>newBlock</code> notification (see below) for each non-finalized block currently in the node's memory (including all forks), then a <code>bestBlockChanged</code> notification. The notifications must be sent in an ordered way such that the parent of each block either can be found in an earlier notification or is the current finalized block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a new block arrives, generates a <code>newBlock</code> notification. If the new block is also the new best block of the node, also generates a <code>bestBlockChanged</code> notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the node finalizes a block, generates a <code>finalized</code> notification indicating which blocks have been finalized and which blocks have been pruned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the node is overloaded and cannot avoid a gap in the notifications, or in case of a warp syncing, or if the maximum number of pinned blocks is reached (see below), generates a <code>stop</code> notification indicating that the subscription is now dead and must be re-created. No more notifications will be sent out on this subscription.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This list of notifications makes it very easy for a JSON-RPC client to follow just the best block updates (listening to just <code>bestBlockChanged</code> events) or follow just the finalized block updates (listening to just <code>initialized</code> and <code>finalized</code> events). It is however not possible to easily figure out whether the runtime has been modified when these updates happen. This is not problematic, as anyone using the JSON-RPC interface naively propably doesn't need to account for runtime changes anyway.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code>, and <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> JSON-RPC function might cause the subscription to produce additional notifications.</p>
<h2 id="the-withruntime-parameter"><a class="header" href="#the-withruntime-parameter">The <code>withRuntime</code> parameter</a></h2>
<p>If the <code>withRuntime</code> parameter is <code>true</code>, then blocks shouldn't (and can't) be reported to JSON-RPC clients before the JSON-RPC server has finished obtaining the runtime specification of the blocks that it reports. This includes the finalized blocks reported in the <code>initialized</code> event.</p>
<p>If <code>withRuntime</code> is <code>false</code>, then the <code>initialized</code> event must be sent back quickly after the function returns. If <code>withRuntime</code> is <code>true</code>, then the JSON-RPC server can take as much time as it wants to send back the <code>initialized</code> event.</p>
<p>For this reason, blocks might be reported more quickly when <code>withRuntime</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is unlikely that high-level UIs built on top of a JSON-RPC client can do anything before the JSON-RPC server has access to the runtime. Consequently, they should consider the time before the <code>initialized</code> event is generated as a loading time. During this loading time, the JSON-RPC server might be performing downloads and CPU-intensive operations. This loading time can be considered as a replacement for the <code>isSyncing</code> field of the legacy <code>system_health</code> JSON-RPC call.</p>
<p>If a JSON-RPC client wants to be sure to receive an <code>initialized</code> event quickly but is also interested in the runtime, it is encouraged to create two subscriptions: one with <code>withRuntime: true</code> and one with <code>withRuntime: false</code>.</p>
<h2 id="notifications-format"><a class="header" href="#notifications-format">Notifications format</a></h2>

<h3 id="stop"><a class="header" href="#stop">stop</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;stop&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>stop</code> event indicates that the JSON-RPC server was unable to provide a consistent list of the blocks at the head of the chain. This can happen because too many blocks have been pinned, because doing so would use an unreasonable amount of memory, or because a consensus mechanism creates a gap in the chain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In particular, warp syncing algorithms create a &quot;jump&quot; in the chain from a block to a much later block. Any subscription that is active when the warp syncing happens will receive a <code>stop</code> event.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated with this <code>subscription</code>.</p>
<p>Calling <code>chainHead_unstable_unfollow</code> on a subscription that has produced a <code>stop</code> event is optional.</p>
<h2 id="pinning"><a class="header" href="#pinning">Pinning</a></h2>
<p>The finalized blocks reported in the <code>initialized</code> event, and each subsequent block reported with a <code>newBlock</code> event, are automatically considered by the JSON-RPC server as <em>pinned</em>. A block is guaranteed to not leave the node's memory for as long as it is pinned, making it possible to call functions such as <code>chainHead_unstable_header</code> on it. Blocks must be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client by calling <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code>.</p>
<p>When a block is unpinned, on-going calls to <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> and <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> against this block will still finish normally.</p>
<p>A block is pinned only in the context of a specific subscription. If multiple <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions exist, then each <code>(subscription, block)</code> tuple must be unpinned individually. Blocks stay pinned even if they have been pruned from the chain of blocks, and must always be unpinned by the JSON-RPC client.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server is strongly encouraged to enforce a limit to the maximum number of pinned blocks. If this limit is reached, it should then stop the subscription by emitting a <code>stop</code> event.
This specification does not mention any specific limit, but it must be large enough for clients to be able to pin all existing non-finalized blocks and the finalized blocks that have been reported in the previous few seconds or minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A JSON-RPC client should call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> only after it is sure to no longer be interested in a certain block. This typically happens after the block has been finalized or pruned. There is no requirement to call <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code> as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: JSON-RPC server implementers should be aware that the number of non-finalized blocks might grow to become very large, for example in the case where the finality mechanism of the chain has an issue. When enforcing a limit to the number of pinned blocks, care must be taken to not prevent the API from being unusable in that situation. A good way to implement this limit is to limit only the number of pinned <em>finalized</em> blocks.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-subscriptions"><a class="header" href="#multiple-subscriptions">Multiple subscriptions</a></h2>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must accept at least 2 <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions per JSON-RPC client. Trying to open more might lead to a JSON-RPC error when calling <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>. In other words, as long as a JSON-RPC client starts 2 or fewer <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions, it is guaranteed that this return value will never happen.</p>
<p>If a JSON-RPC client maintains mutiple <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions at the same time, it has no guarantee that the blocks reported by the various subscriptions are the same. While the finalized blocks reported should eventually be the same, it is possible that in the short term some subscriptions lag behind others.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For example, imagine there exists two active <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscriptions named A and B. Block N is announced on the peer-to-peer network and is announced to A. But then a sibling of block N gets finalized, leading to block N being pruned. Block N might never be announced to B.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-runtime"><a class="header" href="#about-the-runtime">About the runtime</a></h2>
<p>The format of the <code>finalizedBlockRuntime</code> and <code>newRuntime</code> fields can be one of:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In normal situations, the <code>type</code> is <code>valid</code>.</p>
<p>The fields of <code>spec</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>specName</code>: Opaque string indicating the name of the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>implName</code>: Opaque string indicating the name of the implementation of the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>specVersion</code>: Opaque integer. The JSON-RPC client can assume that the call to <code>Metadata_metadata</code> will always produce the same output as long as the <code>specVersion</code> is the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>implVersion</code>: Opaque integer. Whenever the runtime code changes in a backwards-compatible way, the <code>implVersion</code> is modified while the <code>specVersion</code> is left untouched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>transactionVersion</code>: Opaque integer. Necessary when building the bytes of a transaction. Transactions that have been generated with a different <code>transactionVersion</code> are incompatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>apis</code>: Object containing a list of &quot;entry point APIs&quot; supported by the runtime. Each key is an opaque string indicating the API, and each value is an integer version number. Before making a runtime call (using <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code>), you should make sure that this list contains the entry point API corresponding to the call and with a known version number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In Substrate, the keys in the <code>apis</code> field consists of the hexadecimal-encoded 8-bytes blake2 hash of the name of the API. For example, the <code>TaggedTransactionQueue</code> API is <code>0xd2bc9897eed08f15</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The format of <code>apis</code> is not the same as in the legacy JSON-RPC API.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The list of fields is only a subset of the list of so-called &quot;runtime specification&quot; found in the runtime. The fields that aren't useful from a JSON-RPC client perspective are intentionally not included.</p>

    &quot;result&quot;: &quot;started&quot;,
    &quot;operationId&quot;: ...

<p>This return value indicates that the request has successfully started.</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operationId</code> is a string containing an opaque value representing the operation.</li>
<li><code>discardedItems</code> is an integer indicating the number of items at the back of the array of the <code>items</code> parameters that couldn't be processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the list the JSON-RPC server is overloaded, it might refuse to accept new storage requests. In that situation, the JSON-RPC server will discard some or all the <code>items</code> passed as parameter. The number of items discarded is indicated in <code>discardedItems</code>. When that happens, the JSON-RPC client should try again after an on-going <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code>, <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code>, or <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> operation finishes.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must accept at least 16 concurrent operations for any given <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscription. In other words, as long as the JSON-RPC client makes sure that no more than 16 operations are in progress at any given item, it is guaranteed that all of its operations will be accepted by the JSON-RPC server.
For this purpose, each item requested through <code>chainHead_unstable_storage</code> counts as one operation, and each call to <code>chainHead_unstable_body</code> and <code>chainHead_unstable_call</code> counts as one operation.</p>
<h3 id="limitreached-2"><a class="header" href="#limitreached-2">LimitReached</a></h3>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;result&quot;: &quot;limitReached&quot;

<p>This return value indicates that all the items would be discarded, or that the provided <code>followSubscription</code> is invalid or stale.</p>
<h2 id="overview-3"><a class="header" href="#overview-3">Overview</a></h2>
<p>For each item in <code>items</code>, the JSON-RPC server must start obtaining the value of the entry with the given <code>key</code> from the storage, either from the main trie or from <code>childTrie</code>. If <code>type</code> is <code>descendantsValues</code> or <code>descendantsHashes</code>, then it must also obtain the values of all the descendants of the entry.</p>
<p>For the purpose of storage requests, the trie root hash of the child tries of the storage can be found in the main trie at keys starting the bytes of the ASCII string <code>:child_storage:</code>. This behaviour is consistent with all the other storage-request-alike mechanisms of Polkadot and Substrate-based chains, such as host functions or libp2p network requests.</p>
<p>The progress of the operation is indicated through <code>operationStorageItems</code>, <code>operationWaitingForContinue</code>, <code>operationStorageDone</code>, <code>operationInaccessible</code>, or <code>operationError</code> notifications generated on the corresponding <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code> subscription.</p>
<p>The operation continues even if the target block is unpinned with <code>chainHead_unstable_unpin</code>.</p>
<p>This function should be seen as a complement to <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>, allowing the JSON-RPC client to retrieve more information about a block that has been reported. Use <code>archive_unstable_storage</code> if instead you want to retrieve the storage of an arbitrary block.</p>
<p><code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationStorageItems&quot;}</code> notifications will be generated. Each notification contains a list of items. The list of items, concatenated together, forms the result.</p>
<p>If the <code>type</code> of an item is <code>value</code>, and <code>key</code> is associated with a storage value in the trie, then the result will include an item that contains this storage value. If <code>key</code> is not associated with a storage value in the trie, then the result will not include such item.</p>
<p>If the <code>type</code> of an item is <code>hash</code>, the behavior is similar to a <code>type</code> equal to <code>value</code>, except that the cryptographic hash of the value is included in the result rather than the value itself. The hashing algorithm used is the one of the chain, which is typically blake2b. This can lead to significantly less bandwidth usage and can be used in order to compare the value of an item with a known hash and querying the full value only if it differs.</p>
<p>If the <code>type</code> of an item is <code>descendantsValues</code> or <code>descendantsHashes</code>, then the result will contain zero or more items whose key starts with the <code>key</code> of this item.</p>
<p>If the <code>type</code> of an item is <code>closestDescendantMerkleValue</code>, then the so-called trie Merkle value of the <code>key</code> can be found in the result. If <code>key</code> doesn't exist in the trie, then the Merkle value of the closest descendant of <code>key</code> (including branch nodes) is provided. If <code>key</code> doesn't have any descendant in the trie, then the result will not contain any relevant item.</p>
<p>If <code>items</code> contains multiple identical or overlapping queries, the JSON-RPC server can choose whether to merge or not the items in the result. For example, if the request contains two items with the same key, one with <code>hash</code> and one with <code>value</code>, the JSON-RPC server can choose whether to generate two <code>item</code> objects, one with the value and one with the hash, or only a single <code>item</code> object with both <code>hash</code> and <code>value</code> set. The JSON-RPC server is encouraged to notify as soon as possible of the information at its disposal, without waiting for missing information.</p>
<p>It is allowed (but discouraged) for the JSON-RPC server to provide the same information multiple times in the result, for example providing the <code>value</code> field of the same <code>key</code> twice. Forcing the JSON-RPC server to de-duplicate items in the result might lead to unnecessary overhead.</p>
<p>If a <code>{&quot;event&quot;: &quot;operationWaitingForContinue&quot;}</code> notification is generated, the subscription will not generate any more notification unless the JSON-RPC client calls the <code>chainHead_unstable_continue</code> JSON-RPC function. The JSON-RPC server is encouraged to generate this event after having sent a certain number of bytes to the JSON-RPC client in order to avoid head-of-line-blocking issues.</p>

<p>The functions with the <code>chainSpec</code> prefix allow inspecting the content of the specification of the chain a JSON-RPC server is targeting.</p>
<p>Because the chain specification never changes while a JSON-RPC server is running, the return value of all these functions must never change and can be cached by the JSON-RPC client.</p>

<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>any</em></p>
<p>Returns the JSON payload found in the chain specification under the key <code>properties</code>. No guarantee is offered about the content of this object.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server is allowed to re-format the JSON payload found in the chain specification. In other words, whitespaces aren't necessarily preserved.</p>
<p>The value returned by this function must never change for the lifetime of the connection between the JSON-RPC client and server.</p>
<h2 id="usage-3"><a class="header" href="#usage-3">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Because no guarantee is offered about the nature of the returned value, this JSON-RPC function is expected to be used in contexts where the JSON-RPC client knows what the <code>properties</code> field contains.</p>
<p>The <code>properties</code> field is a useful way for a chain developer to store important information about their chain, such as the name of the token or the number of decimals, in the chain specification. Without this field, important constants would need to be copy-pasted across all UIs that connect to said chain, potentially leading to mistakes.</p>

<p>The functions with the <code>sudo</code> prefix are targeted at blockchain node operators who want to inspect the state of their blockchain node.</p>
<p>Contrary to functions with other prefixes, functions with the <code>sudo</code> prefix are meant to be called on a specific JSON-RPC server, and not for example on a load balancer. When implementing a load balancer in front of multiple JSON-RPC servers, functions with the <code>sudo</code> prefix should be forbidden.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sudo_unstable_p2pdiscover"><a class="header" href="#sudo_unstable_p2pdiscover">sudo_unstable_p2pDiscover</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>multiaddr</code>: String containing a text representation of <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr">a multiaddress</a> that ends with <code>/p2p/...</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>none</em></p>
<p>Adds an entry to the address book of peer-to-peer nodes of the JSON-RPC server.
The multiaddress passed as parameter should contain the address and identity of a node serving the libp2p protocol.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server might start connecting to this node, but it is also free to entirely ignore it.</p>
<p>An example of a valid multiaddress is <code>/ip4/10.2.83.208/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWSNvfxTYrtxqAGmYM1VAtg6YMuAGWvjQ28UvoYoBBgANr</code>.</p>
<p>A JSON-RPC error should be returned if the JSON-RPC server doesn't support the protocols in the address. In this example, the JSON-RPC server should return an error if it doesn't support plain TCP connections.</p>
<p>Because a JSON-RPC server is also free to completely ignore the address, it is not strictly mandatory to return a JSON-RPC error when its protocols are not supported.</p>
<p>However, a JSON-RPC server must always return a JSON-RPC error if it couldn't parse the address. A JSON-RPC client can rely on this behavior to validate user-provided multiaddresses.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-8"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-8">Possible errors</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the JSON-RPC server couldn't parse <code>multiaddr</code>.</li>
<li>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the JSON-RPC server doesn't support some of the protocols in the <code>multiaddr</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-errors"><a class="header" href="#about-errors">About errors</a></h2>
<p>It could be useful for a JSON-RPC client to be able to distinguish between addresses that are completely malformed, and would return an error on all JSON-RPC servers, and addresses that contain unsupported protocols, which could be supported by other JSON-RPC servers.</p>
<p>A better API for this function would consist in returning a JSON-RPC error only if the address if malformed, and a successful response containing a boolean equal to <code>false</code> if the address contains unsupported protocols.</p>
<p>However, this would force JSON-RPC servers to support parsing all the protocols currently defined in the multiaddress specification. Because the multiaddress specification doesn't use proper versioning and is constantly getting new protocol additions, this would be tedious to enforce.</p>
<p>Instead, an invalid multiaddress and an unsupported protocol lead to the same JSON-RPC error so that JSON-RPC servers only need to be able to parse the protocols they support.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subscription</code>: An opaque string that was returned by <code>sudo_network_unstable_watch</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>null</em></p>
<p>JSON-RPC client implementations must be aware that, due to the asynchronous nature of JSON-RPC client &lt;-&gt; server communication, they might still receive notifications concerning this subscription, for example because these notifications were already in the process of being sent back by the JSON-RPC server.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>: <em>none</em></p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String containing an opaque value representing the subscription.</p>
<p>This functions lets the JSON-RPC client track the state of the peer-to-peer networking of the blockchain node associated to the JSON-RPC server.</p>
<p>The subscription can later be stopped by calling <code>sudo_network_unstable_unwatch</code>.</p>
<p>When this function is called, a <code>connectionState</code> event is generated for each connection that already exists, and a <code>substreamState</code> event is generated for each substream that already exists. In other words, the JSON-RPC server must send its current networking state to the JSON-RPC client.
In addition, the JSON-RPC server is encouraged to notify the JSON-RPC client of connections and substreams that have recently been closed.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must accept at least one <code>sudo_network_unstable_watch</code> subscriptions per JSON-RPC client. Trying to open more might lead to a JSON-RPC error when calling <code>sudo_network_unstable_watch</code>. In other words, as long as a JSON-RPC client only starts one <code>sudo_network_unstable_watch</code> subscriptions, it is guaranteed that this return value will never happen.</p>

<p>A <code>connectionState</code> event is generated when a new connection attempt is started, when a connection has finished its handshaking phase, or when a connection is terminated.</p>
<p><code>connectionId</code> is an opaque string representing this specific connection.</p>
<p><code>status</code> indicates the state of the connection: <code>connecting</code> if the connection hasn't finished its handshake phase (including the libp2p-specific handshakes), <code>open</code> if the connection is fully established and can open substreams, or <code>closed</code> if the connection is now dead.</p>
<p>Each <code>connectionId</code> must follow one of the follow <code>status</code> transitions: <code>connecting</code> then <code>open</code> then <code>closed</code>, or <code>connecting</code> then <code>closed</code> (if an error happend during the handshake). The JSON-RPC server is not allowed to omit events such as the <code>connecting</code> event.</p>
<p>Once a <code>connectionState</code> event with <code>status</code> equal to <code>closed</code> is generated, the <code>connectionId</code> is unallocated. Any further usage of the same <code>connectionId</code> designates a different connection instead.</p>
<p>If <code>status</code> is <code>closed</code>, the connection must not have any associated substream still alive. A <code>substreamEvent</code> of <code>status</code> equal to <code>closed</code> must have been generated earlier for each substream that corresponds to this connection.</p>
<p>If <code>status</code> is <code>open</code> or <code>closed</code>, the <code>targetPeerId</code> is a string containing the string representation of the PeerId of the remote side of the connection. If <code>status</code> is <code>connecting</code> and <code>direction</code> is <code>in</code>, the <code>targetPeerId</code> must be omitted.

<p><code>targetMultiaddr</code> is a string containing the string representation of the multiaddress of the remote side of the connection. The value in the <code>targetMultiaddr</code> field must always be the same for all the events related to a specific connection.

<p><code>direction</code> indicates whether the connection was initiated locally (<code>out</code>) or by the remote (<code>in</code>). The value in the <code>direction</code> field must always be the same for all the events related to a specific connection. In other words, a connection never changes direction during its lifetime.</p>

<p>A <code>substreamState</code> event is generated when a new connection attempt is started, when a connection has finished its handshaking phase, or when a connection is terminated.</p>
<p><code>connectionId</code> is an opaque string representing this specific connection. It must always correspond to a connection whose latest <code>status</code> is <code>open</code>.</p>
<p><code>substreamId</code> is an opaque string representing this specific substream within the connection. Each substream is identified by the <code>connectionId</code> + <code>substreamId</code> tuple rather than just the <code>substreamId</code> alone. The JSON-RPC server is allowed to use the same value of <code>substreamId</code> for two different substreams belonging to two different connections.</p>
<p><code>status</code> indicates the state of the substream: <code>open</code> if the substream is &quot;alive&quot;, or <code>closed</code> if the substream is dead. A substream is considered &quot;alive&quot; if the JSON-RPC server allocates resources for this substream, even if the remote isn't aware of said substream.</p>
<p>Each <code>substreamState</code> event where <code>status</code> equal to <code>closed</code> must follow a previous <code>substreamState</code> even for that same substream where <code>status</code> was <code>open</code>. In other words, the JSON-RPC server is not allowed to omit event the <code>open</code> event.</p>
<p>Once a <code>substreamState</code> event with <code>status</code> equal to <code>closed</code> is generated, the <code>substreamId</code> is unallocated.

<p>The <code>missedEvents</code> event is generated in order to inform the JSON-RPC client that it has not been informed of the existence of all connections or substreams due to it being too slow to pull JSON-RPC notifications from the JSON-RPC server.</p>
<p>See the <code>Guarantee of delivery</code> section for more details.</p>
<h2 id="guarantee-of-delivery"><a class="header" href="#guarantee-of-delivery">Guarantee of delivery</a></h2>
<p>JSON-RPC server implementations must be aware of the fact that JSON-RPC clients might pull notifications from the JSON-RPC server at a slower rate than networking events are generated. If this function is implemented naively, a slow or malicious JSON-RPC client can cause the JSON-RPC server to allocate ever-increasing buffers, which could in turn lead to a DoS attack on the JSON-RPC server.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC server implementations are also allowed to completely omit events about connections and substreams whose existence is unknown to the JSON-RPC client. For example, when a connection gets closed, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to not notify the JSON-RPC client if the client wasn't yet notified of the fact that the new-closed connection existed. When that happens, the JSON-RPC server must send a <code>missedEvents</code> event to the JSON-RPC client in the nearby future.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC clients must be aware that they aren't guaranteed to see the list of all connections and all substreams that the peer-to-peer endpoint of the node associated to the JSON-RPC server performs. The JSON-RPC client is only guaranteed to be aware of what is currently happening.</p>
<p>Assuming that the number of total active <code>sudo_network_unstable_watch</code> subscriptions on any given JSON-RPC server is bounded, and that the number of total active connections and substreams is bounded, the size of the buffer of notifications to send back to JSON-RPC clients is also bounded.</p>
<h2 id="about-timestamps"><a class="header" href="#about-timestamps">About timestamps</a></h2>
<p>The <code>connectionState</code> and <code>substreamState</code> events contain a <code>when</code> field indicating when the event happened.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server isn't required to order events by the value in their <code>when</code> field. The JSON-RPC is only required to order events so that they don't lose their logical meaning. For example, when two different connections open, the JSON-RPC server can send the two <code>connectionState</code> events in any order. When a connection opens then closes, the JSON-RPC server must send a <code>connectionState</code> with a <code>status</code> equal to <code>open</code> before the <code>connectionState</code> with a <code>status</code> equal to <code>closed</code>.</p>

</ul>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must check that the runtime supports the <code>SessionKeys</code> API (64bits blake2 hash: <code>0xab3c0572291feb8b</code>) at version 1, and call the <code>SessionKeys_generate_session_keys</code> runtime function.
The runtime call is done against the current best block of the chain.</p>
<p>If there is no <code>SessionKeys</code> API being supported, or if it is not at version 1, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to call an alternative version of this function if it is sensible to do so. For example, if the <code>SessionKeys</code> API is updated to version 2 without a substantial change in the logic of <code>SessionKeys_generate_session_keys</code>, then the JSON-RPC server is allowed to call it as well. This specification should be updated if that happens.</p>
<p>Contrary to most other JSON-RPC functions that perform runtime function calls where side-effects are forbidden, this runtime must be allowed to call host functions that access the keys of the node (e.g. <code>ext_crypto_sr25519_generate_version_1</code>, <code>ext_crypto_ed25519_public_keys_version_1</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The objective of this JSON-RPC function is to call the <code>SessionKeys_generate_session_keys</code> runtime function. This paragraph describes how this runtime function behaves.</p>
<p>The <code>SessionKeys_generate_session_keys</code> runtime function generates a serie of keys, inserts these keys in the so-called keystore, and returns all the public keys concatenated together.</p>
<p>Because the newly-generated keys are inserted in the keystore of the JSON-RPC server, it will automatically start performing duties such as authoring blocks or emitting Grandpa votes if one of the generated public keys corresponds to a key that is given the rights by the blockchain to do so. Most of the time, the keystore is configured to write the keys on disk, meaning that these newly-generated keys remain in the keystore even after the JSON-RPC server has been restarted.</p>
<p>The value returned by this function, which is the concatenation of all newly-generated public keys, is called the session keys. The session keys are meant to be submitted to the blockchain via a transaction by the JSON-RPC client or its user. Before this is done, the newly-generated keys normally don't automatically obtain the right to, for example, generate blocks. Submitting the session keys to the blockchain is out of scope of this function.</p>

<p>The <code>transaction</code> functions allow broadcasting a transaction for inclusion in the chain.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="transaction_unstable_broadcast"><a class="header" href="#transaction_unstable_broadcast">transaction_unstable_broadcast</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>transaction</code>: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded transaction to try to include in a block.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String representing the operation, or <code>null</code> if the maximum number of broadcasted transactions has been reached.</p>
<p>The string returned by this function is opaque and its meaning can't be interpreted by the JSON-RPC client.</p>
<p>Once this function has been called, the JSON-RPC server will try to propagate this transaction over the peer-to-peer network until <code>transaction_unstable_stop</code> is called.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server must allow at least 4 transactions being broadcasted at the same time per JSON-RPC client.
Any attempt to broadcast more than 4 transactions simultaneously might result in <code>null</code> being returned.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server might check whether the transaction is valid before broadcasting it. If it does so and if the transaction is invalid, the server should silently do nothing and the JSON-RPC client is not informed of the problem. Invalid transactions should still count towards the limit to the number of simultaneously broadcasted transactions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="transaction_unstable_stop"><a class="header" href="#transaction_unstable_stop">transaction_unstable_stop</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operationId</code>: Opaque string equal to the value returned by <code>transaction_unstable_broadcast</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>null</em></p>
<p>The node will no longer try to broadcast the transaction over the peer-to-peer network.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-11"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-11">Possible errors</a></h2>
<p>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the <code>operationId</code> doesn't correspond to any active <code>transaction_unstable_broadcast</code> operation.</p>

<p>The <code>transactionWatch</code> functions allow submitting a transaction for inclusion in the chain.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="transactionwatch_unstable_submitandwatch"><a class="header" href="#transactionwatch_unstable_submitandwatch">transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>transaction</code>: String containing the hexadecimal-encoded SCALE-encoded transaction to try to include in a block.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: String representing the subscription.</p>
<p>The string returned by this function is opaque and its meaning can't be interpreted by the JSON-RPC client. It is only meant to be matched with the <code>subscription</code> field of events and potentially passed to <code>transactionWatch_unstable_unwatch</code>.</p>
<p>Once this function has been called, the server will try to propagate this transaction over the peer-to-peer network and/or include it onto the chain even if <code>transactionWatch_unstable_unwatch</code> is called or that the JSON-RPC client disconnects. In other words, it is not possible to cancel submitting a transaction.</p>
<h2 id="notifications-format-2"><a class="header" href="#notifications-format-2">Notifications format</a></h2>
<p>This function will later generate one or more notifications in the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;,
    &quot;method&quot;: &quot;transactionWatch_unstable_watchEvent&quot;,
    &quot;params&quot;: {
        &quot;subscription&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,
        &quot;result&quot;: ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>subscription</code> is the value returned by this function, and <code>result</code> can be one of:</p>
<h3 id="validated"><a class="header" href="#validated">validated</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;validated&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>validated</code> event indicates that this transaction has been checked and is considered as valid by the runtime.</p>
<p>This transaction might still become invalid in the future, for example because a conflicting transaction is included in the chain in-between.</p>
<p>Multiple <code>validated</code> events can be generated during the lifetime of a transaction. If multiple <code>validated</code> events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last one.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In theory, this event could include a field indicating the block against which this transaction was validated. It has been decided to not include this field for pragmatic reasons: implementing it might be complicated, and it is not very useful for a JSON-RPC client to know this information.</p>
<h3 id="bestchainblockincluded"><a class="header" href="#bestchainblockincluded">bestChainBlockIncluded</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;bestChainBlockIncluded&quot;,
    &quot;block&quot;: {
        &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,
        &quot;index&quot;: ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;bestChainBlockIncluded&quot;,
    &quot;block&quot;: null
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> event indicates which block of the best chain the transaction is included in.</p>
<p><code>null</code> can be sent back in case the block is no longer in any block of the best chain. This is the state a transaction starts in.</p>
<p><code>hash</code> is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block. <code>index</code> is an integer indicating the 0-based index of this transaction within the body of this block.</p>
<p>If multiple <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> events happen in a row, the JSON-RPC server is allowed to skip all but the last.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please note that these is no guarantee that the mentioned block matches any of the blocks returned by <code>chainHead_unstable_follow</code>.</p>
<h3 id="finalized-1"><a class="header" href="#finalized-1">finalized</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;finalized&quot;,
    &quot;block&quot;: {
        &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,
        &quot;index&quot;: ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>finalized</code> event indicates that this transaction is present in a block of the chain that is finalized.</p>
<p><code>hash</code> is a string containing the hexadecimal-encoded hash of the header of the block. <code>index</code> is an integer indicating the 0-based index of this transaction within the body of this block.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h3 id="error"><a class="header" href="#error">error</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>error</code> event indicates that an internal error within the client has happened.</p>
<p>Examples include: the runtime crashes, the runtime is missing the function to validate a transaction, the format of the value returned by the runtime is invalid, etc.</p>
<p>This typically indicates a bug in the runtime of the chain or an incompatibility between the client and the runtime of the chain, and there is nothing the end user can do to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The transaction that has been submitted will not be included in the chain by the local node, but it could be included by sending it via a different client implementation.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating what happened. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-1"><a class="header" href="#invalid-1">invalid</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;invalid&quot;,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>invalid</code> event indicates that the runtime has marked the transaction as invalid.</p>
<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons specific to the chain, such as a bad signature, bad nonce, not enough balance for fees, etc.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction is invalid. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h3 id="dropped"><a class="header" href="#dropped">dropped</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;dropped&quot;,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dropped</code> event indicates that the client wasn't capable of keeping track of this transaction.</p>
<p>This can happen for example if the JSON-RPC server's transactions pool is full, if the JSON-RPC server's resources have reached their limit, if the block the transaction is included in takes too long to be finalized, or the syncing requires a gap in the chain that prevents the JSON-RPC server from knowing whether the transaction has been included and/or finalized.</p>
<p><code>error</code> is a human-readable error message indicating why the transaction has been dropped. This string isn't meant to be shown to end users, but is for developers to understand the problem.</p>
<p>No more event will be generated about this transaction.</p>
<h2 id="transaction-state"><a class="header" href="#transaction-state">Transaction state</a></h2>
<p>One can build a mental model in order to understand which events can be generated. While a transaction is being watched, it has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>isValidated</code>: <code>yes</code> or <code>not-yet</code>. A transaction is initially <code>not-yet</code> validated. A <code>validated</code> event indicates that the transaction has now been validated. After a certain number of blocks or in case of retractation, a transaction automatically becomes <code>not-yet</code> validated and needs to be validated again. No event is generated to indicate that a transaction is no longer validated, however a <code>validated</code> event will be generated again when a transaction is validated again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code>: an optional block hash and index. A transaction is initially included in no block. It can automatically become included in a block of the best chain. A <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> event reports updates to this property.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these two properties are orthogonal. In particular, a transaction can be included in a block before being validated.</p>
<p>The <code>finalized</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>invalid</code>, and <code>dropped</code> event indicate that the transaction is no longer being watched. The state of the transaction is entirely discarded.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC servers are allowed to skip sending events as long as it properly keeps the JSON-RPC client up to date with the state of the transaction. In other words, multiple <code>validated</code> or <code>bestChainBlockIncluded</code> events in a row might be merged into one.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to implement this properly, JSON-RPC servers should maintain a buffer of three notifications (one for each property), and overwrite any unsent notification with a more recent status update.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-12"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-12">Possible errors</a></h2>
<p>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the <code>transaction</code> parameter has an invalid format, but no error is produced if the bytes of the <code>transaction</code>, once decoded, are invalid. Instead, an <code>invalid</code> notification will be generated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="transactionwatch_unstable_unwatch"><a class="header" href="#transactionwatch_unstable_unwatch">transactionWatch_unstable_unwatch</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subscription</code>: Opaque string equal to the value returned by <code>transactionWatch_unstable_submitAndWatch</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return value</strong>: <em>null</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This function does not remove the transaction from the pool. In other words, the node will still try to include the transaction in the chain. Having a function that removes the transaction from the pool would be almost useless, as the node might have already gossiped it to the rest of the network.</p>
<h2 id="possible-errors-13"><a class="header" href="#possible-errors-13">Possible errors</a></h2>
<p>A JSON-RPC error is generated if the <code>subscription</code> doesn't correspond to any active subscription.</p>
